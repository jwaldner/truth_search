# Proverbs <!-- Start Verse Index: 16401 -->

## Chapter 1

**1.** The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; <!-- Index: 16401 -->

**2.** To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; <!-- Index: 16402 -->

**3.** To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; <!-- Index: 16403 -->

**4.** To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. <!-- Index: 16404 -->

**5.** A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: <!-- Index: 16405 -->

**6.** To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. <!-- Index: 16406 -->

**7.** The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. <!-- Index: 16407 -->

**8.** My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: <!-- Index: 16408 -->

**9.** For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. <!-- Index: 16409 -->

**10.** My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. <!-- Index: 16410 -->

**11.** If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: <!-- Index: 16411 -->

**12.** Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: <!-- Index: 16412 -->

**13.** We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: <!-- Index: 16413 -->

**14.** Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: <!-- Index: 16414 -->

**15.** My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: <!-- Index: 16415 -->

**16.** For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. <!-- Index: 16416 -->

**17.** Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. <!-- Index: 16417 -->

**18.** And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. <!-- Index: 16418 -->

**19.** So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. <!-- Index: 16419 -->

**20.** Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: <!-- Index: 16420 -->

**21.** She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, <!-- Index: 16421 -->

**22.** How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? <!-- Index: 16422 -->

**23.** Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. <!-- Index: 16423 -->

**24.** Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; <!-- Index: 16424 -->

**25.** But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: <!-- Index: 16425 -->

**26.** I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; <!-- Index: 16426 -->

**27.** When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. <!-- Index: 16427 -->

**28.** Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: <!-- Index: 16428 -->

**29.** For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: <!-- Index: 16429 -->

**30.** They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. <!-- Index: 16430 -->

**31.** Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. <!-- Index: 16431 -->

**32.** For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. <!-- Index: 16432 -->

**33.** But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. <!-- Index: 16433 -->

## Chapter 2

**1.** My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; <!-- Index: 16434 -->

**2.** So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; <!-- Index: 16435 -->

**3.** Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; <!-- Index: 16436 -->

**4.** If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; <!-- Index: 16437 -->

**5.** Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. <!-- Index: 16438 -->

**6.** For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. <!-- Index: 16439 -->

**7.** He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. <!-- Index: 16440 -->

**8.** He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. <!-- Index: 16441 -->

**9.** Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. <!-- Index: 16442 -->

**10.** When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; <!-- Index: 16443 -->

**11.** Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: <!-- Index: 16444 -->

**12.** To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; <!-- Index: 16445 -->

**13.** Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; <!-- Index: 16446 -->

**14.** Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; <!-- Index: 16447 -->

**15.** Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: <!-- Index: 16448 -->

**16.** To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; <!-- Index: 16449 -->

**17.** Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. <!-- Index: 16450 -->

**18.** For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. <!-- Index: 16451 -->

**19.** None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. <!-- Index: 16452 -->

**20.** That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. <!-- Index: 16453 -->

**21.** For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. <!-- Index: 16454 -->

**22.** But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. <!-- Index: 16455 -->

## Chapter 3

**1.** My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: <!-- Index: 16456 -->

**2.** For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. <!-- Index: 16457 -->

**3.** Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: <!-- Index: 16458 -->

**4.** So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. <!-- Index: 16459 -->

**5.** Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. <!-- Index: 16460 -->

**6.** In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. <!-- Index: 16461 -->

**7.** Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil. <!-- Index: 16462 -->

**8.** It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. <!-- Index: 16463 -->

**9.** Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: <!-- Index: 16464 -->

**10.** So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. <!-- Index: 16465 -->

**11.** My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction: <!-- Index: 16466 -->

**12.** For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. <!-- Index: 16467 -->

**13.** Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. <!-- Index: 16468 -->

**14.** For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. <!-- Index: 16469 -->

**15.** She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. <!-- Index: 16470 -->

**16.** Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. <!-- Index: 16471 -->

**17.** Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. <!-- Index: 16472 -->

**18.** She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. <!-- Index: 16473 -->

**19.** The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. <!-- Index: 16474 -->

**20.** By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. <!-- Index: 16475 -->

**21.** My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: <!-- Index: 16476 -->

**22.** So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. <!-- Index: 16477 -->

**23.** Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. <!-- Index: 16478 -->

**24.** When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. <!-- Index: 16479 -->

**25.** Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. <!-- Index: 16480 -->

**26.** For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. <!-- Index: 16481 -->

**27.** Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. <!-- Index: 16482 -->

**28.** Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. <!-- Index: 16483 -->

**29.** Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. <!-- Index: 16484 -->

**30.** Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. <!-- Index: 16485 -->

**31.** Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. <!-- Index: 16486 -->

**32.** For the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous. <!-- Index: 16487 -->

**33.** The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. <!-- Index: 16488 -->

**34.** Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. <!-- Index: 16489 -->

**35.** The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. <!-- Index: 16490 -->

## Chapter 4

**1.** Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. <!-- Index: 16491 -->

**2.** For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. <!-- Index: 16492 -->

**3.** For I was my father‚Äôs son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. <!-- Index: 16493 -->

**4.** He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. <!-- Index: 16494 -->

**5.** Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. <!-- Index: 16495 -->

**6.** Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. <!-- Index: 16496 -->

**7.** Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. <!-- Index: 16497 -->

**8.** Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. <!-- Index: 16498 -->

**9.** She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. <!-- Index: 16499 -->

**10.** Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. <!-- Index: 16500 -->

**11.** I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. <!-- Index: 16501 -->

**12.** When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. <!-- Index: 16502 -->

**13.** Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. <!-- Index: 16503 -->

**14.** Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. <!-- Index: 16504 -->

**15.** Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. <!-- Index: 16505 -->

**16.** For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. <!-- Index: 16506 -->

**17.** For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. <!-- Index: 16507 -->

**18.** But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. <!-- Index: 16508 -->

**19.** The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. <!-- Index: 16509 -->

**20.** My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. <!-- Index: 16510 -->

**21.** Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. <!-- Index: 16511 -->

**22.** For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. <!-- Index: 16512 -->

**23.** Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. <!-- Index: 16513 -->

**24.** Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. <!-- Index: 16514 -->

**25.** Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. <!-- Index: 16515 -->

**26.** Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. <!-- Index: 16516 -->

**27.** Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil. <!-- Index: 16517 -->

## Chapter 5

**1.** My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: <!-- Index: 16518 -->

**2.** That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. <!-- Index: 16519 -->

**3.** For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: <!-- Index: 16520 -->

**4.** But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. <!-- Index: 16521 -->

**5.** Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. <!-- Index: 16522 -->

**6.** Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. <!-- Index: 16523 -->

**7.** Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. <!-- Index: 16524 -->

**8.** Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: <!-- Index: 16525 -->

**9.** Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: <!-- Index: 16526 -->

**10.** Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; <!-- Index: 16527 -->

**11.** And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, <!-- Index: 16528 -->

**12.** And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; <!-- Index: 16529 -->

**13.** And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! <!-- Index: 16530 -->

**14.** I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. <!-- Index: 16531 -->

**15.** Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. <!-- Index: 16532 -->

**16.** Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. <!-- Index: 16533 -->

**17.** Let them be only thine own, and not strangers‚Äô with thee. <!-- Index: 16534 -->

**18.** Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. <!-- Index: 16535 -->

**19.** Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. <!-- Index: 16536 -->

**20.** And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? <!-- Index: 16537 -->

**21.** For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings. <!-- Index: 16538 -->

**22.** His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. <!-- Index: 16539 -->

**23.** He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. <!-- Index: 16540 -->

## Chapter 6

**1.** My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, <!-- Index: 16541 -->

**2.** Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. <!-- Index: 16542 -->

**3.** Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. <!-- Index: 16543 -->

**4.** Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. <!-- Index: 16544 -->

**5.** Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. <!-- Index: 16545 -->

**6.** Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: <!-- Index: 16546 -->

**7.** Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, <!-- Index: 16547 -->

**8.** Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. <!-- Index: 16548 -->

**9.** How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? <!-- Index: 16549 -->

**10.** Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: <!-- Index: 16550 -->

**11.** So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. <!-- Index: 16551 -->

**12.** A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. <!-- Index: 16552 -->

**13.** He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; <!-- Index: 16553 -->

**14.** Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. <!-- Index: 16554 -->

**15.** Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. <!-- Index: 16555 -->

**16.** These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: <!-- Index: 16556 -->

**17.** A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, <!-- Index: 16557 -->

**18.** An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, <!-- Index: 16558 -->

**19.** A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. <!-- Index: 16559 -->

**20.** My son, keep thy father‚Äôs commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: <!-- Index: 16560 -->

**21.** Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. <!-- Index: 16561 -->

**22.** When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. <!-- Index: 16562 -->

**23.** For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: <!-- Index: 16563 -->

**24.** To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. <!-- Index: 16564 -->

**25.** Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. <!-- Index: 16565 -->

**26.** For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. <!-- Index: 16566 -->

**27.** Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? <!-- Index: 16567 -->

**28.** Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? <!-- Index: 16568 -->

**29.** So he that goeth in to his neighbour‚Äôs wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. <!-- Index: 16569 -->

**30.** Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; <!-- Index: 16570 -->

**31.** But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. <!-- Index: 16571 -->

**32.** But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. <!-- Index: 16572 -->

**33.** A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. <!-- Index: 16573 -->

**34.** For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. <!-- Index: 16574 -->

**35.** He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. <!-- Index: 16575 -->

## Chapter 7

**1.** My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. <!-- Index: 16576 -->

**2.** Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. <!-- Index: 16577 -->

**3.** Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. <!-- Index: 16578 -->

**4.** Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: <!-- Index: 16579 -->

**5.** That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. <!-- Index: 16580 -->

**6.** For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, <!-- Index: 16581 -->

**7.** And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, <!-- Index: 16582 -->

**8.** Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, <!-- Index: 16583 -->

**9.** In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: <!-- Index: 16584 -->

**10.** And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. <!-- Index: 16585 -->

**11.** (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: <!-- Index: 16586 -->

**12.** Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) <!-- Index: 16587 -->

**13.** So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, <!-- Index: 16588 -->

**14.** I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. <!-- Index: 16589 -->

**15.** Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. <!-- Index: 16590 -->

**16.** I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. <!-- Index: 16591 -->

**17.** I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. <!-- Index: 16592 -->

**18.** Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. <!-- Index: 16593 -->

**19.** For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: <!-- Index: 16594 -->

**20.** He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. <!-- Index: 16595 -->

**21.** With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. <!-- Index: 16596 -->

**22.** He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; <!-- Index: 16597 -->

**23.** Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. <!-- Index: 16598 -->

**24.** Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. <!-- Index: 16599 -->

**25.** Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. <!-- Index: 16600 -->

**26.** For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. <!-- Index: 16601 -->

**27.** Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. <!-- Index: 16602 -->

## Chapter 8

**1.** Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? <!-- Index: 16603 -->

**2.** She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. <!-- Index: 16604 -->

**3.** She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. <!-- Index: 16605 -->

**4.** Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. <!-- Index: 16606 -->

**5.** O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. <!-- Index: 16607 -->

**6.** Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. <!-- Index: 16608 -->

**7.** For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. <!-- Index: 16609 -->

**8.** All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. <!-- Index: 16610 -->

**9.** They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. <!-- Index: 16611 -->

**10.** Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. <!-- Index: 16612 -->

**11.** For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. <!-- Index: 16613 -->

**12.** I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. <!-- Index: 16614 -->

**13.** The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. <!-- Index: 16615 -->

**14.** Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. <!-- Index: 16616 -->

**15.** By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. <!-- Index: 16617 -->

**16.** By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. <!-- Index: 16618 -->

**17.** I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. <!-- Index: 16619 -->

**18.** Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. <!-- Index: 16620 -->

**19.** My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. <!-- Index: 16621 -->

**20.** I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: <!-- Index: 16622 -->

**21.** That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. <!-- Index: 16623 -->

**22.** The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. <!-- Index: 16624 -->

**23.** I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. <!-- Index: 16625 -->

**24.** When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. <!-- Index: 16626 -->

**25.** Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: <!-- Index: 16627 -->

**26.** While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. <!-- Index: 16628 -->

**27.** When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: <!-- Index: 16629 -->

**28.** When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: <!-- Index: 16630 -->

**29.** When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: <!-- Index: 16631 -->

**30.** Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; <!-- Index: 16632 -->

**31.** Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. <!-- Index: 16633 -->
