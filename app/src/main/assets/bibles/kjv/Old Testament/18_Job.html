<h1>Job</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='18_01:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</p>
<p id='18_01:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p id='18_01:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</p>
<p id='18_01:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</p>
<p id='18_01:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</p>
<p id='18_01:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.</p>
<p id='18_01:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
<p id='18_01:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>
<p id='18_01:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>
<p id='18_01:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>
<p id='18_01:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>
<p id='18_01:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p id='18_01:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:</p>
<p id='18_01:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</p>
<p id='18_01:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p id='18_01:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p id='18_01:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p id='18_01:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:</p>
<p id='18_01:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
<p id='18_01:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</p>
<p id='18_01:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.</p>
<p id='18_01:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<p id='18_02:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.</p>
<p id='18_02:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
<p id='18_02:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</p>
<p id='18_02:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</p>
<p id='18_02:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>
<p id='18_02:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</p>
<p id='18_02:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</p>
<p id='18_02:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</p>
<p id='18_02:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</p>
<p id='18_02:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</p>
<p id='18_02:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</p>
<p id='18_02:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</p>
<p id='18_02:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_3'>Chapter 3</h2>
<p id='18_03:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>
<p id='18_03:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And Job spake, and said,</p>
<p id='18_03:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</p>
<p id='18_03:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</p>
<p id='18_03:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</p>
<p id='18_03:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p id='18_03:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p id='18_03:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</p>
<p id='18_03:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</p>
<p id='18_03:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</p>
<p id='18_03:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</p>
<p id='18_03:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</p>
<p id='18_03:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>
<p id='18_03:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</p>
<p id='18_03:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>
<p id='18_03:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</p>
<p id='18_03:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</p>
<p id='18_03:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p id='18_03:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p id='18_03:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</p>
<p id='18_03:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
<p id='18_03:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p id='18_03:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>
<p id='18_03:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>
<p id='18_03:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</p>
<p id='18_03:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_4'>Chapter 4</h2>
<p id='18_04:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
<p id='18_04:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p id='18_04:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
<p id='18_04:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>
<p id='18_04:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
<p id='18_04:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>
<p id='18_04:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>
<p id='18_04:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>
<p id='18_04:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</p>
<p id='18_04:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
<p id='18_04:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.</p>
<p id='18_04:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</p>
<p id='18_04:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</p>
<p id='18_04:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</p>
<p id='18_04:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</p>
<p id='18_04:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</p>
<p id='18_04:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>
<p id='18_04:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>
<p id='18_04:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</p>
<p id='18_04:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</p>
<p id='18_04:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_5'>Chapter 5</h2>
<p id='18_05:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</p>
<p id='18_05:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</p>
<p id='18_05:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>
<p id='18_05:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</p>
<p id='18_05:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</p>
<p id='18_05:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</p>
<p id='18_05:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</p>
<p id='18_05:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</p>
<p id='18_05:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</p>
<p id='18_05:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</p>
<p id='18_05:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</p>
<p id='18_05:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</p>
<p id='18_05:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</p>
<p id='18_05:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</p>
<p id='18_05:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</p>
<p id='18_05:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>
<p id='18_05:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</p>
<p id='18_05:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</p>
<p id='18_05:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>
<p id='18_05:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</p>
<p id='18_05:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p>
<p id='18_05:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p id='18_05:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p>
<p id='18_05:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</p>
<p id='18_05:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</p>
<p id='18_05:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</p>
<p id='18_05:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_6'>Chapter 6</h2>
<p id='18_06:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> But Job answered and said,</p>
<p id='18_06:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</p>
<p id='18_06:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</p>
<p id='18_06:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>
<p id='18_06:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>
<p id='18_06:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p id='18_06:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</p>
<p id='18_06:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>
<p id='18_06:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
<p id='18_06:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p id='18_06:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</p>
<p id='18_06:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</p>
<p id='18_06:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p>
<p id='18_06:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p id='18_06:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</p>
<p id='18_06:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</p>
<p id='18_06:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
<p id='18_06:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</p>
<p id='18_06:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
<p id='18_06:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</p>
<p id='18_06:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</p>
<p id='18_06:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</p>
<p id='18_06:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</p>
<p id='18_06:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
<p id='18_06:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</p>
<p id='18_06:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</p>
<p id='18_06:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</p>
<p id='18_06:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</p>
<p id='18_06:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</p>
<p id='18_06:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</p>
<h2 id='chapter_7'>Chapter 7</h2>

<p id='18_20:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</p>
<p id='18_20:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</p>

<p id='18_20:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</p>
<p id='18_20:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>
<p id='18_20:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.</p>
<p id='18_20:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</p>
<p id='18_20:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</p>
<p id='18_20:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</p>
<p id='18_20:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</p>

<p id='18_20:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</p>
<p id='18_20:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</p>

<p id='18_21:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p id='18_21:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>

<p id='18_21:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p id='18_21:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>
<p id='18_21:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>

<p id='18_22:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</p>

<p id='18_22:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p>
<p id='18_22:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</p>
<p id='18_22:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</p>

<p id='18_22:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>

<p id='18_23:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p id='18_23:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>
<p id='18_23:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</p>
<p id='18_23:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p id='18_23:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>

<p id='18_23:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p id='18_23:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>
<p id='18_23:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
<p id='18_23:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</p>
<p id='18_23:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</p>
<p id='18_23:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p id='18_23:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</p>

<p id='18_24:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.</p>

<p id='18_24:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</p>
<p id='18_24:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
<p id='18_24:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>
<p id='18_24:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</p>

<p id='18_24:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
<p id='18_24:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</p>
<p id='18_24:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p>
<p id='18_24:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>

<p id='18_24:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>

<p id='18_29:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p id='18_29:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</p>

<p id='18_29:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p id='18_29:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</p>

<p id='18_29:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</p>
<p id='18_29:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p>
<p id='18_29:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</p>

<p id='18_29:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p id='18_29:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p>
<p id='18_29:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>

<p id='18_30:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>
<p id='18_30:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</p>
<p id='18_30:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p>
<p id='18_30:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>
<p id='18_30:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p id='18_30:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</p>
<p id='18_30:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>

<p id='18_30:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</p>
<p id='18_30:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p id='18_30:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>
<p id='18_30:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</p>
<p id='18_30:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>

<p id='18_30:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</p>

<p id='18_31:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>

<p id='18_32:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
<p id='18_32:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
<p id='18_32:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>
<p id='18_32:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p id='18_32:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>

<p id='18_32:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</p>

<p id='18_33:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p id='18_33:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>
<p id='18_33:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>
<p id='18_33:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</p>
<p id='18_33:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p id='18_33:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p id='18_33:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</p>
<p id='18_33:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</p>
<p id='18_33:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</p>
<p id='18_33:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>
<p id='18_33:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
<p id='18_33:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>
<p id='18_33:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p>
<p id='18_33:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>
<p id='18_33:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</p>
<p id='18_33:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p id='18_33:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p id='18_33:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</p>
<p id='18_33:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p>
<p id='18_33:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p id='18_33:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p id='18_33:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</p>
<p id='18_33:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
<p id='18_33:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:</p>
<p id='18_33:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>
<p id='18_33:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</p>
<p id='18_33:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>
<p id='18_33:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</p>
<p id='18_33:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p id='18_33:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p id='18_33:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p id='18_33:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_34'>Chapter 34</h2>
<p id='18_34:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p id='18_34:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p id='18_34:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p>
<p id='18_34:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p id='18_34:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</p>
<p id='18_34:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</p>
<p id='18_34:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
<p id='18_34:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>
<p id='18_34:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>
<p id='18_34:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
<p id='18_34:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p id='18_34:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p id='18_34:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
<p id='18_34:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
<p id='18_34:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</p>
<p id='18_34:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p id='18_34:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</p>
<p id='18_34:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</p>
<p id='18_34:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p id='18_34:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</p>
<p id='18_34:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</p>
<p id='18_34:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p id='18_34:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</p>
<p id='18_34:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</p>
<p id='18_34:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p id='18_34:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>
<p id='18_34:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</p>
<p id='18_34:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p id='18_34:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</p>
<p id='18_34:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p>
<p id='18_34:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</p>
<p id='18_34:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>
<p id='18_34:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
<p id='18_34:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</p>
<p id='18_34:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</p>
<p id='18_34:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</p>
<p id='18_34:037' data-selected='false'><strong>37.</strong> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_35'>Chapter 35</h2>
<p id='18_35:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Elihu spake moreover, and said,</p>
<p id='18_35:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s?</p>
<p id='18_35:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</p>
<p id='18_35:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>
<p id='18_35:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</p>
<p id='18_35:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p>
<p id='18_35:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</p>
<p id='18_35:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</p>
<p id='18_35:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p id='18_35:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</p>
<p id='18_35:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</p>
<p id='18_35:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p id='18_35:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p id='18_35:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</p>
<p id='18_35:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</p>
<p id='18_35:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_36'>Chapter 36</h2>
<p id='18_36:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p>
<p id='18_36:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf.</p>
<p id='18_36:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p id='18_36:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>
<p id='18_36:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</p>
<p id='18_36:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</p>
<p id='18_36:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p id='18_36:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</p>
<p id='18_36:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>
<p id='18_36:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p id='18_36:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
<p id='18_36:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p id='18_36:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</p>
<p id='18_36:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</p>
<p id='18_36:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</p>
<p id='18_36:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</p>
<p id='18_36:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</p>
<p id='18_36:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</p>
<p id='18_36:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>
<p id='18_36:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>
<p id='18_36:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p id='18_36:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</p>
<p id='18_36:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</p>
<p id='18_36:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</p>
<p id='18_36:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</p>
<p id='18_36:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>
<p id='18_36:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</p>
<p id='18_36:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</p>
<p id='18_36:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</p>
<p id='18_36:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p id='18_36:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</p>
<p id='18_36:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</p>
<p id='18_36:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_37'>Chapter 37</h2>
<p id='18_37:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</p>
<p id='18_37:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p id='18_37:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p id='18_37:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>
<p id='18_37:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p id='18_37:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>
<p id='18_37:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>
<p id='18_37:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p>
<p id='18_37:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</p>
<p id='18_37:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p id='18_37:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</p>
<p id='18_37:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</p>
<p id='18_37:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
<p id='18_37:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p id='18_37:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p id='18_37:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p id='18_37:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</p>
<p id='18_37:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</p>
<p id='18_37:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>
<p id='18_37:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p id='18_37:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
<p id='18_37:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</p>
<p id='18_37:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>
<p id='18_37:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_38'>Chapter 38</h2>
<p id='18_38:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p id='18_38:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p id='18_38:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</p>
<p id='18_38:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
<p id='18_38:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</p>
<p id='18_38:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</p>
<p id='18_38:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p id='18_38:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</p>
<p id='18_38:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</p>
<p id='18_38:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</p>
<p id='18_38:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>
<p id='18_38:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;</p>
<p id='18_38:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</p>
<p id='18_38:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p>
<p id='18_38:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>
<p id='18_38:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</p>
<p id='18_38:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</p>
<p id='18_38:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</p>

<p id='18_41:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>
<p id='18_41:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>
<p id='18_41:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</p>
<p id='18_41:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>

<p id='18_42:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</p>
<p id='18_42:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</p>
<p id='18_42:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted Job.</p>
<p id='18_42:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
<p id='18_42:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</p>
<p id='18_42:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
<p id='18_42:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p id='18_42:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren–happuch.</p>
<p id='18_42:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>
<p id='18_42:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.</p>
<p id='18_42:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>
