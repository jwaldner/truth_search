<h1>Judges</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='07_01:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</p>
<p id='07_01:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</p>
<p id='07_01:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</p>
<p id='07_01:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</p>
<p id='07_01:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And they found Adoni–bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p>
<p id='07_01:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> But Adoni–bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</p>
<p id='07_01:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And Adoni–bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</p>
<p id='07_01:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</p>
<p id='07_01:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</p>
<p id='07_01:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath–arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</p>
<p id='07_01:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath–sepher:</p>
<p id='07_01:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath–sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</p>
<p id='07_01:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</p>
<p id='07_01:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</p>
<p id='07_01:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</p>
<p id='07_01:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</p>
<p id='07_01:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</p>
<p id='07_01:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</p>
<p id='07_01:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</p>
<p id='07_01:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</p>
<p id='07_01:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</p>
<p id='07_01:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth–el: and the Lord was with them.</p>
<p id='07_01:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth–el. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</p>
<p id='07_01:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</p>
<p id='07_01:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</p>
<p id='07_01:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.</p>
<p id='07_01:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth–shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</p>
<p id='07_01:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</p>
<p id='07_01:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</p>
<p id='07_01:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</p>
<p id='07_01:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</p>
<p id='07_01:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</p>
<p id='07_01:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth–shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth–anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth–shemesh and of Beth–anath became tributaries unto them.</p>
<p id='07_01:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</p>
<p id='07_01:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</p>
<p id='07_01:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<p id='07_02:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</p>
<p id='07_02:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</p>
<p id='07_02:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</p>
<p id='07_02:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And it came to pass, when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</p>
<p id='07_02:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the Lord.</p>
<p id='07_02:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</p>
<p id='07_02:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord, that he did for Israel.</p>
<p id='07_02:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p>
<p id='07_02:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath–heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</p>
<p id='07_02:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</p>
<p id='07_02:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim:</p>
<p id='07_02:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger.</p>
<p id='07_02:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</p>
<p id='07_02:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</p>
<p id='07_02:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</p>
<p id='07_02:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</p>
<p id='07_02:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they did not so.</p>
<p id='07_02:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</p>
<p id='07_02:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</p>
<p id='07_02:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</p>
<p id='07_02:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</p>
<p id='07_02:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.</p>
<p id='07_02:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_3'>Chapter 3</h2>
<p id='07_03:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</p>
<p id='07_03:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</p>
<p id='07_03:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal–hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</p>
<p id='07_03:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p id='07_03:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</p>
<p id='07_03:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</p>
<p id='07_03:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgat the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</p>
<p id='07_03:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan–rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan–rishathaim eight years.</p>
<p id='07_03:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.</p>
<p id='07_03:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Lord delivered Chushan–rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan–rishathaim.</p>
<p id='07_03:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p>
<p id='07_03:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord.</p>
<p id='07_03:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</p>
<p id='07_03:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p>
<p id='07_03:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</p>
<p id='07_03:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</p>
<p id='07_03:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</p>
<p id='07_03:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</p>
<p id='07_03:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</p>
<p id='07_03:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</p>
<p id='07_03:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</p>
<p id='07_03:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</p>
<p id='07_03:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</p>
<p id='07_03:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</p>
<p id='07_03:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</p>
<p id='07_03:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</p>
<p id='07_03:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</p>
<p id='07_03:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</p>
<p id='07_03:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</p>
<p id='07_03:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</p>
<p id='07_03:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_4'>Chapter 4</h2>
<p id='07_04:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead.</p>
<p id='07_04:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</p>
<p id='07_04:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</p>
<p id='07_04:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</p>
<p id='07_04:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth–el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</p>
<p id='07_04:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh–naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</p>
<p id='07_04:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.</p>
<p id='07_04:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.</p>
<p id='07_04:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</p>
<p id='07_04:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</p>
<p id='07_04:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</p>
<p id='07_04:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</p>
<p id='07_04:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</p>
<p id='07_04:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the Lord gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</p>
<p id='07_04:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</p>
<p id='07_04:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</p>
<p id='07_04:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</p>
<p id='07_04:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</p>
<p id='07_04:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</p>
<p id='07_04:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</p>
<p id='07_04:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</p>
<p id='07_04:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.</p>
<p id='07_04:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</p>
<p id='07_04:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_5'>Chapter 5</h2>

<p id='07_06:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.</p>

<p id='07_06:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</p>
<p id='07_06:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</p>

<p id='07_06:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</p>

<p id='07_06:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi–ezer was gathered after him.</p>

<p id='07_07:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</p>
<p id='07_07:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</p>
<p id='07_07:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</p>
<p id='07_07:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</p>
<p id='07_07:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</p>
<p id='07_07:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</p>

<p id='07_07:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</p>
<p id='07_07:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</p>
<p id='07_07:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</p>
<p id='07_07:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</p>
<p id='07_07:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</p>

<p id='07_08:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</p>
<p id='07_08:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</p>
<p id='07_08:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels’ necks.</p>
<p id='07_08:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</p>
<p id='07_08:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.</p>
<p id='07_08:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</p>

<p id='07_09:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,</p>

<p id='07_09:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.</p>

<p id='07_09:042' data-selected='false'><strong>42.</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</p>

<p id='07_09:045' data-selected='false'><strong>45.</strong> And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</p>
<p id='07_09:046' data-selected='false'><strong>46.</strong> And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</p>

<p id='07_09:048' data-selected='false'><strong>48.</strong> And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.</p>
<p id='07_09:049' data-selected='false'><strong>49.</strong> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</p>
<p id='07_09:050' data-selected='false'><strong>50.</strong> Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</p>
<p id='07_09:051' data-selected='false'><strong>51.</strong> But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.</p>
<p id='07_09:052' data-selected='false'><strong>52.</strong> And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</p>
<p id='07_09:053' data-selected='false'><strong>53.</strong> And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and all to brake his skull.</p>

<p id='07_11:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</p>
<p id='07_11:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</p>

<p id='07_11:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</p>
<p id='07_11:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.</p>
<p id='07_11:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p id='07_11:037' data-selected='false'><strong>37.</strong> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</p>
<p id='07_11:038' data-selected='false'><strong>38.</strong> And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</p>
<p id='07_11:039' data-selected='false'><strong>39.</strong> And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</p>

<p id='07_12:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.</p>

<p id='07_12:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?</p>
<p id='07_12:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.</p>
<p id='07_12:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;</p>
<p id='07_12:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right.

<p id='07_12:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.</p>

<h2 id='chapter_13'>Chapter 13</h2>
<p id='07_13:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</p>
<p id='07_13:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.</p>
<p id='07_13:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.</p>
<p id='07_13:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:</p>
<p id='07_13:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p id='07_13:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:</p>

<p id='07_13:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.</p>
<p id='07_13:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.</p>
<p id='07_13:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.</p>
<p id='07_13:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?</p>
<p id='07_13:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</p>

<p id='07_13:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.</p>
<p id='07_13:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?</p>

<p id='07_13:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</p>
<p id='07_13:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.</p>
<p id='07_13:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> But the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord.</p>
<p id='07_13:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</p>
<p id='07_13:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.</p>
<p id='07_13:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.</p>
<p id='07_13:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_14'>Chapter 14</h2>
<p id='07_14:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.</p>

<p id='07_14:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?

<p id='07_14:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</p>
<p id='07_14:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</p>
<p id='07_14:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</p>
<p id='07_14:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</p>
<p id='07_14:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</p>
<p id='07_14:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</p>
<p id='07_14:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</p>
<p id='07_14:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</p>
<p id='07_14:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</p>
<p id='07_14:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</p>
<p id='07_14:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</p>
<p id='07_14:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?</p>
<p id='07_14:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me.

<p id='07_14:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</p>
<p id='07_14:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</p>
<p id='07_14:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.</p>
<p id='07_14:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_15'>Chapter 15</h2>
<p id='07_15:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.</p>
<p id='07_15:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</p>
<p id='07_15:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</p>
<p id='07_15:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</p>
<p id='07_15:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</p>
<p id='07_15:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</p>
<p id='07_15:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</p>
<p id='07_15:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</p>
<p id='07_15:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</p>
<p id='07_15:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</p>
<p id='07_15:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</p>
<p id='07_15:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</p>
<p id='07_15:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.</p>
<p id='07_15:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</p>
<p id='07_15:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</p>
<p id='07_15:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</p>
<p id='07_15:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath–lehi.</p>
<p id='07_15:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</p>
<p id='07_15:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En–hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.</p>
<p id='07_15:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_16'>Chapter 16</h2>
<p id='07_16:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.</p>
<p id='07_16:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.</p>
<p id='07_16:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.</p>
<p id='07_16:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</p>
<p id='07_16:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</p>
<p id='07_16:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.</p>
<p id='07_16:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
<p id='07_16:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</p>
<p id='07_16:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.</p>
<p id='07_16:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</p>
<p id='07_16:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
<p id='07_16:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</p>
<p id='07_16:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</p>
<p id='07_16:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</p>
<p id='07_16:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</p>
<p id='07_16:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;</p>
<p id='07_16:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.</p>
<p id='07_16:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</p>
<p id='07_16:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</p>
<p id='07_16:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.</p>
<p id='07_16:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.</p>
<p id='07_16:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</p>
<p id='07_16:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</p>
<p id='07_16:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</p>
<p id='07_16:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</p>

<p id='07_17:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</p>

<p id='07_18:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</p>

<p id='07_20:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</p>
<p id='07_20:037' data-selected='false'><strong>37.</strong> And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p id='07_20:038' data-selected='false'><strong>38.</strong> Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</p>
<p id='07_20:039' data-selected='false'><strong>39.</strong> And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</p>
<p id='07_20:040' data-selected='false'><strong>40.</strong> But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</p>
<p id='07_20:041' data-selected='false'><strong>41.</strong> And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</p>
<p id='07_20:042' data-selected='false'><strong>42.</strong> Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</p>
<p id='07_20:043' data-selected='false'><strong>43.</strong> Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</p>
<p id='07_20:044' data-selected='false'><strong>44.</strong> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.</p>
<p id='07_20:045' data-selected='false'><strong>45.</strong> And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</p>
<p id='07_20:046' data-selected='false'><strong>46.</strong> So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.</p>
<p id='07_20:047' data-selected='false'><strong>47.</strong> But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</p>
<p id='07_20:048' data-selected='false'><strong>48.</strong> And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</p>

<p id='07_21:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</p>
<p id='07_21:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;</p>
<p id='07_21:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And said, O Lord God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?</p>
<p id='07_21:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</p>
<p id='07_21:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the Lord? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p id='07_21:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</p>
<p id='07_21:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</p>
<p id='07_21:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh–gilead to the assembly.</p>
<p id='07_21:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead there.</p>
<p id='07_21:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</p>
<p id='07_21:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</p>
<p id='07_21:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p id='07_21:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</p>
<p id='07_21:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh–gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</p>
<p id='07_21:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p id='07_21:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</p>
<p id='07_21:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</p>
<p id='07_21:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</p>
<p id='07_21:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Beth–el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth–el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</p>
<p id='07_21:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</p>
<p id='07_21:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</p>
