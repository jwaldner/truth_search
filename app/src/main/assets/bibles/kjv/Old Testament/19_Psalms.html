<h1>Psalms</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='19_01:001'><strong>1.</strong> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p id='19_01:002'><strong>2.</strong> But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>
<p id='19_01:003'><strong>3.</strong> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
<p id='19_01:004'><strong>4.</strong> The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>
<p id='19_01:005'><strong>5.</strong> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>
<p id='19_01:006'><strong>6.</strong> For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<p id='19_02:001'><strong>1.</strong> Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
<p id='19_02:002'><strong>2.</strong> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,</p>
<p id='19_02:003'><strong>3.</strong> Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
<p id='19_02:004'><strong>4.</strong> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</p>
<p id='19_02:005'><strong>5.</strong> Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>
<p id='19_02:006'><strong>6.</strong> Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
<p id='19_02:007'><strong>7.</strong> I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p id='19_02:008'><strong>8.</strong> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>
<p id='19_02:009'><strong>9.</strong> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.</p>
<p id='19_02:010'><strong>10.</strong> Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>
<p id='19_02:011'><strong>11.</strong> Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p id='19_02:012'><strong>12.</strong> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_3'>Chapter 3</h2>
<p id='19_03:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</p>
<p id='19_03:002'><strong>2.</strong> Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</p>
<p id='19_03:003'><strong>3.</strong> But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>
<p id='19_03:004'><strong>4.</strong> I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>
<p id='19_03:005'><strong>5.</strong> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.</p>
<p id='19_03:006'><strong>6.</strong> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</p>
<p id='19_03:007'><strong>7.</strong> Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>
<p id='19_03:008'><strong>8.</strong> Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_4'>Chapter 4</h2>
<p id='19_04:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p>
<p id='19_04:002'><strong>2.</strong> O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.</p>
<p id='19_04:003'><strong>3.</strong> But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the Lord will hear when I call unto him.</p>
<p id='19_04:004'><strong>4.</strong> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>
<p id='19_04:005'><strong>5.</strong> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_04:006'><strong>6.</strong> There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p>
<p id='19_04:007'><strong>7.</strong> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.</p>
<p id='19_04:008'><strong>8.</strong> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_5'>Chapter 5</h2>
<p id='19_05:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation.</p>
<p id='19_05:002'><strong>2.</strong> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>
<p id='19_05:003'><strong>3.</strong> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</p>
<p id='19_05:004'><strong>4.</strong> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>
<p id='19_05:005'><strong>5.</strong> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>
<p id='19_05:006'><strong>6.</strong> Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>
<p id='19_05:007'><strong>7.</strong> But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p id='19_05:008'><strong>8.</strong> Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
<p id='19_05:009'><strong>9.</strong> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p id='19_05:010'><strong>10.</strong> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>
<p id='19_05:011'><strong>11.</strong> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>
<p id='19_05:012'><strong>12.</strong> For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_6'>Chapter 6</h2>
<p id='19_06:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
<p id='19_06:002'><strong>2.</strong> Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</p>
<p id='19_06:003'><strong>3.</strong> My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?</p>
<p id='19_06:004'><strong>4.</strong> Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
<p id='19_06:005'><strong>5.</strong> For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>
<p id='19_06:006'><strong>6.</strong> I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p>
<p id='19_06:007'><strong>7.</strong> Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</p>
<p id='19_06:008'><strong>8.</strong> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p>
<p id='19_06:009'><strong>9.</strong> The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.</p>
<p id='19_06:010'><strong>10.</strong> Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_7'>Chapter 7</h2>
<p id='19_07:001'><strong>1.</strong> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>
<p id='19_07:002'><strong>2.</strong> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</p>
<p id='19_07:003'><strong>3.</strong> O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>
<p id='19_07:004'><strong>4.</strong> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>
<p id='19_07:005'><strong>5.</strong> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>
<p id='19_07:006'><strong>6.</strong> Arise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</p>
<p id='19_07:007'><strong>7.</strong> So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>
<p id='19_07:008'><strong>8.</strong> The Lord shall judge the people: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</p>
<p id='19_07:009'><strong>9.</strong> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>
<p id='19_07:010'><strong>10.</strong> My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</p>
<p id='19_07:011'><strong>11.</strong> God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.</p>
<p id='19_07:012'><strong>12.</strong> If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
<p id='19_07:013'><strong>13.</strong> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</p>
<p id='19_07:014'><strong>14.</strong> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>
<p id='19_07:015'><strong>15.</strong> He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</p>
<p id='19_07:016'><strong>16.</strong> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>
<p id='19_07:017'><strong>17.</strong> I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_8'>Chapter 8</h2>
<p id='19_08:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</p>
<p id='19_08:002'><strong>2.</strong> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p id='19_08:003'><strong>3.</strong> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</p>
<p id='19_08:004'><strong>4.</strong> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
<p id='19_08:005'><strong>5.</strong> For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</p>
<p id='19_08:006'><strong>6.</strong> Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:</p>
<p id='19_08:007'><strong>7.</strong> All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;</p>
<p id='19_08:008'><strong>8.</strong> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.</p>
<p id='19_08:009'><strong>9.</strong> O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</p>
<h2 id='chapter_9'>Chapter 9</h2>
<p id='19_09:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</p>
<p id='19_09:002'><strong>2.</strong> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>
<p id='19_09:003'><strong>3.</strong> When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</p>
<p id='19_09:004'><strong>4.</strong> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</p>
<p id='19_09:005'><strong>5.</strong> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p>
<p id='19_09:006'><strong>6.</strong> O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</p>
<p id='19_09:007'><strong>7.</strong> But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</p>
<p id='19_09:008'><strong>8.</strong> And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>
<p id='19_09:009'><strong>9.</strong> The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
<p id='19_09:010'><strong>10.</strong> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p>
<p id='19_09:011'><strong>11.</strong> Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</p>
<p id='19_09:012'><strong>12.</strong> When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</p>
<p id='19_09:013'><strong>13.</strong> Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</p>
<p id='19_09:014'><strong>14.</strong> That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p id='19_09:015'><strong>15.</strong> The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p>
<p id='19_09:016'><strong>16.</strong> The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>
<p id='19_09:017'><strong>17.</strong> The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p id='19_09:018'><strong>18.</strong> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.</p>
<p id='19_09:019'><strong>19.</strong> Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</p>
<p id='19_09:020'><strong>20.</strong> Put them in fear, O Lord: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_10'>Chapter 10</h2>
<p id='19_10:001'><strong>1.</strong> Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</p>
<p id='19_10:002'><strong>2.</strong> The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>
<p id='19_10:003'><strong>3.</strong> For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.</p>
<p id='19_10:004'><strong>4.</strong> The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</p>
<p id='19_10:005'><strong>5.</strong> His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>
<p id='19_10:006'><strong>6.</strong> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.</p>
<p id='19_10:007'><strong>7.</strong> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.</p>
<p id='19_10:008'><strong>8.</strong> He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</p>
<p id='19_10:009'><strong>9.</strong> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>
<p id='19_10:010'><strong>10.</strong> He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</p>
<p id='19_10:011'><strong>11.</strong> He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</p>
<p id='19_10:012'><strong>12.</strong> Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</p>
<p id='19_10:013'><strong>13.</strong> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</p>
<p id='19_10:014'><strong>14.</strong> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p>
<p id='19_10:015'><strong>15.</strong> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</p>
<p id='19_10:016'><strong>16.</strong> The Lord is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p>
<p id='19_10:017'><strong>17.</strong> Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>
<p id='19_10:018'><strong>18.</strong> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_11'>Chapter 11</h2>
<p id='19_11:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. In the Lord put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?</p>
<p id='19_11:002'><strong>2.</strong> For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.</p>
<p id='19_11:003'><strong>3.</strong> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>
<p id='19_11:004'><strong>4.</strong> The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</p>
<p id='19_11:005'><strong>5.</strong> The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</p>
<p id='19_11:006'><strong>6.</strong> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.</p>
<p id='19_11:007'><strong>7.</strong> For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_12'>Chapter 12</h2>
<p id='19_12:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p>
<p id='19_12:002'><strong>2.</strong> They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.</p>
<p id='19_12:003'><strong>3.</strong> The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:</p>
<p id='19_12:004'><strong>4.</strong> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?</p>
<p id='19_12:005'><strong>5.</strong> For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.</p>
<p id='19_12:006'><strong>6.</strong> The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>
<p id='19_12:007'><strong>7.</strong> Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p>
<p id='19_12:008'><strong>8.</strong> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_13'>Chapter 13</h2>
<p id='19_13:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</p>
<p id='19_13:002'><strong>2.</strong> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p>
<p id='19_13:003'><strong>3.</strong> Consider and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;</p>
<p id='19_13:004'><strong>4.</strong> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</p>
<p id='19_13:005'><strong>5.</strong> But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p id='19_13:006'><strong>6.</strong> I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_14'>Chapter 14</h2>
<p id='19_14:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.</p>
<p id='19_14:002'><strong>2.</strong> The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.</p>
<p id='19_14:003'><strong>3.</strong> They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p id='19_14:004'><strong>4.</strong> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_14:005'><strong>5.</strong> There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.</p>
<p id='19_14:006'><strong>6.</strong> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge.</p>
<p id='19_14:007'><strong>7.</strong> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_15'>Chapter 15</h2>
<p id='19_15:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Psalm of David. Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</p>
<p id='19_15:002'><strong>2.</strong> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.</p>
<p id='19_15:003'><strong>3.</strong> He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</p>
<p id='19_15:004'><strong>4.</strong> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.</p>
<p id='19_15:005'><strong>5.</strong> He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_16'>Chapter 16</h2>
<p id='19_16:001'><strong>1.</strong> Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</p>
<p id='19_16:002'><strong>2.</strong> O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;</p>
<p id='19_16:003'><strong>3.</strong> But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</p>
<p id='19_16:004'><strong>4.</strong> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</p>
<p id='19_16:005'><strong>5.</strong> The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</p>
<p id='19_16:006'><strong>6.</strong> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</p>
<p id='19_16:007'><strong>7.</strong> I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</p>

<p id='19_17:003'><strong>3.</strong> Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</p>

<h2 id='chapter_18'>Chapter 18</h2>
<p id='19_18:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.</p>
<p id='19_18:002'><strong>2.</strong> The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</p>
<p id='19_18:003'><strong>3.</strong> I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p id='19_18:004'><strong>4.</strong> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
<p id='19_18:005'><strong>5.</strong> The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
<p id='19_18:006'><strong>6.</strong> In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</p>
<p id='19_18:007'><strong>7.</strong> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p id='19_18:008'><strong>8.</strong> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p id='19_18:009'><strong>9.</strong> He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</p>
<p id='19_18:010'><strong>10.</strong> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p id='19_18:011'><strong>11.</strong> He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p id='19_18:012'><strong>12.</strong> At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p id='19_18:013'><strong>13.</strong> The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p id='19_18:014'><strong>14.</strong> Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p id='19_18:015'><strong>15.</strong> Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
<p id='19_18:016'><strong>16.</strong> He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
<p id='19_18:017'><strong>17.</strong> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p id='19_18:018'><strong>18.</strong> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my stay.</p>
<p id='19_18:019'><strong>19.</strong> He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p id='19_18:020'><strong>20.</strong> The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p id='19_18:021'><strong>21.</strong> For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p id='19_18:022'><strong>22.</strong> For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>
<p id='19_18:023'><strong>23.</strong> I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p id='19_18:024'><strong>24.</strong> Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
<p id='19_18:025'><strong>25.</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p id='19_18:026'><strong>26.</strong> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>

<p id='19_18:029'><strong>29.</strong> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p id='19_18:030'><strong>30.</strong> As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p id='19_18:031'><strong>31.</strong> For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God?</p>
<p id='19_18:032'><strong>32.</strong> It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p id='19_18:033'><strong>33.</strong> He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p id='19_18:034'><strong>34.</strong> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p id='19_18:035'><strong>35.</strong> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p id='19_18:036'><strong>36.</strong> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p id='19_18:037'><strong>37.</strong> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p id='19_18:038'><strong>38.</strong> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p id='19_18:039'><strong>39.</strong> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p id='19_18:040'><strong>40.</strong> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p id='19_18:041'><strong>41.</strong> They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Lord, but he answered them not.</p>
<p id='19_18:042'><strong>42.</strong> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p id='19_18:043'><strong>43.</strong> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<p id='19_18:044'><strong>44.</strong> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p id='19_18:045'><strong>45.</strong> The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p id='19_18:046'><strong>46.</strong> The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
<p id='19_18:047'><strong>47.</strong> It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
<p id='19_18:048'><strong>48.</strong> He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p id='19_18:049'><strong>49.</strong> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>

<p id='19_58:002'><strong>2.</strong> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</p>
<p id='19_58:003'><strong>3.</strong> The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</p>
<p id='19_58:004'><strong>4.</strong> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;</p>
<p id='19_58:005'><strong>5.</strong> Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</p>

<p id='19_59:005'><strong>5.</strong> Thou therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</p>

<p id='19_59:011'><strong>11.</strong> Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p>
<p id='19_59:012'><strong>12.</strong> For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.</p>

<p id='19_61:004'><strong>4.</strong> I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.</p>

<p id='19_69:008'><strong>8.</strong> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.</p>
<p id='19_69:009'><strong>9.</strong> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
<p id='19_69:010'><strong>10.</strong> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
<p id='19_69:011'><strong>11.</strong> I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
<p id='19_69:012'><strong>12.</strong> They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p id='19_69:013'><strong>13.</strong> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
<p id='19_69:014'><strong>14.</strong> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>

<p id='19_69:017'><strong>17.</strong> And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>

<p id='19_69:020'><strong>20.</strong> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p id='19_69:021'><strong>21.</strong> They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p id='19_69:022'><strong>22.</strong> Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</p>
<p id='19_69:023'><strong>23.</strong> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
<p id='19_69:024'><strong>24.</strong> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
<p id='19_69:025'><strong>25.</strong> Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</p>

<p id='19_69:028'><strong>28.</strong> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
<p id='19_69:029'><strong>29.</strong> But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
<p id='19_69:030'><strong>30.</strong> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p id='19_69:031'><strong>31.</strong> This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
<p id='19_69:032'><strong>32.</strong> The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
<p id='19_69:033'><strong>33.</strong> For the Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
<p id='19_69:034'><strong>34.</strong> Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
<p id='19_69:035'><strong>35.</strong> For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>

<p id='19_78:005'><strong>5.</strong> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
<p id='19_78:006'><strong>6.</strong> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>
<p id='19_78:007'><strong>7.</strong> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p id='19_78:008'><strong>8.</strong> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p id='19_78:009'><strong>9.</strong> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
<p id='19_78:010'><strong>10.</strong> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
<p id='19_78:011'><strong>11.</strong> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
<p id='19_78:012'><strong>12.</strong> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p id='19_78:013'><strong>13.</strong> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p id='19_78:014'><strong>14.</strong> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
<p id='19_78:015'><strong>15.</strong> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>
<p id='19_78:016'><strong>16.</strong> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
<p id='19_78:017'><strong>17.</strong> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
<p id='19_78:018'><strong>18.</strong> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
<p id='19_78:019'><strong>19.</strong> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p id='19_78:020'><strong>20.</strong> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
<p id='19_78:021'><strong>21.</strong> Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p id='19_78:022'><strong>22.</strong> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
<p id='19_78:023'><strong>23.</strong> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p id='19_78:024'><strong>24.</strong> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p id='19_78:025'><strong>25.</strong> Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p id='19_78:026'><strong>26.</strong> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p id='19_78:027'><strong>27.</strong> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p id='19_78:028'><strong>28.</strong> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p id='19_78:029'><strong>29.</strong> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
<p id='19_78:030'><strong>30.</strong> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p>
<p id='19_78:031'><strong>31.</strong> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
<p id='19_78:032'><strong>32.</strong> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
<p id='19_78:033'><strong>33.</strong> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p id='19_78:034'><strong>34.</strong> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>
<p id='19_78:035'><strong>35.</strong> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
<p id='19_78:036'><strong>36.</strong> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p id='19_78:037'><strong>37.</strong> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p id='19_78:038'><strong>38.</strong> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p id='19_78:039'><strong>39.</strong> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
<p id='19_78:040'><strong>40.</strong> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</p>
<p id='19_78:041'><strong>41.</strong> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p id='19_78:042'><strong>42.</strong> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
<p id='19_78:043'><strong>43.</strong> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>
<p id='19_78:044'><strong>44.</strong> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p id='19_78:045'><strong>45.</strong> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p id='19_78:046'><strong>46.</strong> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
<p id='19_78:047'><strong>47.</strong> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p id='19_78:048'><strong>48.</strong> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p id='19_78:049'><strong>49.</strong> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
<p id='19_78:050'><strong>50.</strong> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p id='19_78:051'><strong>51.</strong> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p id='19_78:052'><strong>52.</strong> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p id='19_78:053'><strong>53.</strong> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p id='19_78:054'><strong>54.</strong> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p id='19_78:055'><strong>55.</strong> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p id='19_78:056'><strong>56.</strong> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p id='19_78:057'><strong>57.</strong> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p id='19_78:058'><strong>58.</strong> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p id='19_78:059'><strong>59.</strong> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p id='19_78:060'><strong>60.</strong> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>
<p id='19_78:061'><strong>61.</strong> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
<p id='19_78:062'><strong>62.</strong> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
<p id='19_78:063'><strong>63.</strong> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
<p id='19_78:064'><strong>64.</strong> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p id='19_78:065'><strong>65.</strong> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p id='19_78:066'><strong>66.</strong> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p id='19_78:067'><strong>67.</strong> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p id='19_78:068'><strong>68.</strong> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p id='19_78:069'><strong>69.</strong> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p id='19_78:070'><strong>70.</strong> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p id='19_78:071'><strong>71.</strong> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p id='19_78:072'><strong>72.</strong> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

<p id='19_106:009'><strong>9.</strong> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>

<p id='19_106:011'><strong>11.</strong> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p id='19_106:012'><strong>12.</strong> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p id='19_106:013'><strong>13.</strong> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
<p id='19_106:014'><strong>14.</strong> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
<p id='19_106:015'><strong>15.</strong> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p id='19_106:016'><strong>16.</strong> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_106:017'><strong>17.</strong> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p id='19_106:018'><strong>18.</strong> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p id='19_106:019'><strong>19.</strong> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
<p id='19_106:020'><strong>20.</strong> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
<p id='19_106:021'><strong>21.</strong> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>

<p id='19_106:023'><strong>23.</strong> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
<p id='19_106:024'><strong>24.</strong> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
<p id='19_106:025'><strong>25.</strong> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_106:026'><strong>26.</strong> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
<p id='19_106:027'><strong>27.</strong> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p id='19_106:028'><strong>28.</strong> They joined themselves also unto Baal–peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p id='19_106:029'><strong>29.</strong> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p id='19_106:030'><strong>30.</strong> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</p>
<p id='19_106:031'><strong>31.</strong> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
<p id='19_106:032'><strong>32.</strong> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p id='19_106:033'><strong>33.</strong> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
<p id='19_106:034'><strong>34.</strong> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them:</p>
<p id='19_106:035'><strong>35.</strong> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
<p id='19_106:036'><strong>36.</strong> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p id='19_106:037'><strong>37.</strong> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
<p id='19_106:038'><strong>38.</strong> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p id='19_106:039'><strong>39.</strong> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p id='19_106:040'><strong>40.</strong> Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p id='19_106:041'><strong>41.</strong> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p id='19_106:042'><strong>42.</strong> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p id='19_106:043'><strong>43.</strong> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p id='19_106:044'><strong>44.</strong> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
<p id='19_106:045'><strong>45.</strong> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p id='19_106:046'><strong>46.</strong> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
<p id='19_106:047'><strong>47.</strong> Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p id='19_106:048'><strong>48.</strong> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.</p>
