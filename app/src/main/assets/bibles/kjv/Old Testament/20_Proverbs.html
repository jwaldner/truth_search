<h1>Proverbs</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='20_01:001'><strong>1.</strong> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>
<p id='20_01:002'><strong>2.</strong> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>
<p id='20_01:003'><strong>3.</strong> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</p>
<p id='20_01:004'><strong>4.</strong> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p id='20_01:005'><strong>5.</strong> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p id='20_01:006'><strong>6.</strong> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p id='20_01:007'><strong>7.</strong> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p id='20_01:008'><strong>8.</strong> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p id='20_01:009'><strong>9.</strong> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p id='20_01:010'><strong>10.</strong> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p id='20_01:011'><strong>11.</strong> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p id='20_01:012'><strong>12.</strong> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>
<p id='20_01:013'><strong>13.</strong> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>
<p id='20_01:014'><strong>14.</strong> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>
<p id='20_01:015'><strong>15.</strong> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p id='20_01:016'><strong>16.</strong> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p id='20_01:017'><strong>17.</strong> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>
<p id='20_01:018'><strong>18.</strong> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</p>
<p id='20_01:019'><strong>19.</strong> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p id='20_01:020'><strong>20.</strong> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>
<p id='20_01:021'><strong>21.</strong> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</p>
<p id='20_01:022'><strong>22.</strong> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p id='20_01:023'><strong>23.</strong> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p id='20_01:024'><strong>24.</strong> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>
<p id='20_01:025'><strong>25.</strong> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p id='20_01:026'><strong>26.</strong> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p id='20_01:027'><strong>27.</strong> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<p id='20_01:028'><strong>28.</strong> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p id='20_01:029'><strong>29.</strong> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:</p>
<p id='20_01:030'><strong>30.</strong> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p id='20_01:031'><strong>31.</strong> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p id='20_01:032'><strong>32.</strong> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p id='20_01:033'><strong>33.</strong> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<p id='20_02:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>
<p id='20_02:002'><strong>2.</strong> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</p>
<p id='20_02:003'><strong>3.</strong> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</p>
<p id='20_02:004'><strong>4.</strong> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</p>
<p id='20_02:005'><strong>5.</strong> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p id='20_02:006'><strong>6.</strong> For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p id='20_02:007'><strong>7.</strong> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p id='20_02:008'><strong>8.</strong> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>
<p id='20_02:009'><strong>9.</strong> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</p>
<p id='20_02:010'><strong>10.</strong> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</p>
<p id='20_02:011'><strong>11.</strong> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>
<p id='20_02:012'><strong>12.</strong> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>
<p id='20_02:013'><strong>13.</strong> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p id='20_02:014'><strong>14.</strong> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>
<p id='20_02:015'><strong>15.</strong> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</p>
<p id='20_02:016'><strong>16.</strong> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</p>
<p id='20_02:017'><strong>17.</strong> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p id='20_02:018'><strong>18.</strong> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>
<p id='20_02:019'><strong>19.</strong> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p id='20_02:020'><strong>20.</strong> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p id='20_02:021'><strong>21.</strong> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p id='20_02:022'><strong>22.</strong> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_3'>Chapter 3</h2>
<p id='20_03:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p id='20_03:002'><strong>2.</strong> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p>
<p id='20_03:003'><strong>3.</strong> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</p>
<p id='20_03:004'><strong>4.</strong> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p id='20_03:005'><strong>5.</strong> Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p id='20_03:006'><strong>6.</strong> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</p>
<p id='20_03:007'><strong>7.</strong> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</p>
<p id='20_03:008'><strong>8.</strong> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</p>
<p id='20_03:009'><strong>9.</strong> Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</p>
<p id='20_03:010'><strong>10.</strong> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p id='20_03:011'><strong>11.</strong> My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction:</p>
<p id='20_03:012'><strong>12.</strong> For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</p>
<p id='20_03:013'><strong>13.</strong> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</p>
<p id='20_03:014'><strong>14.</strong> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p id='20_03:015'><strong>15.</strong> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p id='20_03:016'><strong>16.</strong> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.</p>
<p id='20_03:017'><strong>17.</strong> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</p>
<p id='20_03:018'><strong>18.</strong> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</p>
<p id='20_03:019'><strong>19.</strong> The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</p>
<p id='20_03:020'><strong>20.</strong> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p id='20_03:021'><strong>21.</strong> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p id='20_03:022'><strong>22.</strong> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p id='20_03:023'><strong>23.</strong> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p id='20_03:024'><strong>24.</strong> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p id='20_03:025'><strong>25.</strong> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>
<p id='20_03:026'><strong>26.</strong> For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p id='20_03:027'><strong>27.</strong> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</p>
<p id='20_03:028'><strong>28.</strong> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p id='20_03:029'><strong>29.</strong> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>
<p id='20_03:030'><strong>30.</strong> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p id='20_03:031'><strong>31.</strong> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>
<p id='20_03:032'><strong>32.</strong> For the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous.</p>
<p id='20_03:033'><strong>33.</strong> The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</p>
<p id='20_03:034'><strong>34.</strong> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>
<p id='20_03:035'><strong>35.</strong> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_4'>Chapter 4</h2>
<p id='20_04:001'><strong>1.</strong> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p id='20_04:002'><strong>2.</strong> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</p>
<p id='20_04:003'><strong>3.</strong> For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p id='20_04:004'><strong>4.</strong> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p id='20_04:005'><strong>5.</strong> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p id='20_04:006'><strong>6.</strong> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p id='20_04:007'><strong>7.</strong> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p id='20_04:008'><strong>8.</strong> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p id='20_04:009'><strong>9.</strong> She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</p>
<p id='20_04:010'><strong>10.</strong> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>
<p id='20_04:011'><strong>11.</strong> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</p>
<p id='20_04:012'><strong>12.</strong> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p id='20_04:013'><strong>13.</strong> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.</p>
<p id='20_04:014'><strong>14.</strong> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</p>
<p id='20_04:015'><strong>15.</strong> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p id='20_04:016'><strong>16.</strong> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</p>
<p id='20_04:017'><strong>17.</strong> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p id='20_04:018'><strong>18.</strong> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
<p id='20_04:019'><strong>19.</strong> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p id='20_04:020'><strong>20.</strong> My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>
<p id='20_04:021'><strong>21.</strong> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>
<p id='20_04:022'><strong>22.</strong> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>
<p id='20_04:023'><strong>23.</strong> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</p>
<p id='20_04:024'><strong>24.</strong> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</p>
<p id='20_04:025'><strong>25.</strong> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p id='20_04:026'><strong>26.</strong> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</p>
<p id='20_04:027'><strong>27.</strong> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_5'>Chapter 5</h2>
<p id='20_05:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:</p>
<p id='20_05:002'><strong>2.</strong> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p id='20_05:003'><strong>3.</strong> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</p>
<p id='20_05:004'><strong>4.</strong> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</p>
<p id='20_05:005'><strong>5.</strong> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p id='20_05:006'><strong>6.</strong> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</p>
<p id='20_05:007'><strong>7.</strong> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p id='20_05:008'><strong>8.</strong> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>
<p id='20_05:009'><strong>9.</strong> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</p>
<p id='20_05:010'><strong>10.</strong> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;</p>
<p id='20_05:011'><strong>11.</strong> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p id='20_05:012'><strong>12.</strong> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p id='20_05:013'><strong>13.</strong> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p id='20_05:014'><strong>14.</strong> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p id='20_05:015'><strong>15.</strong> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p id='20_05:016'><strong>16.</strong> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p id='20_05:017'><strong>17.</strong> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.</p>
<p id='20_05:018'><strong>18.</strong> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p id='20_05:019'><strong>19.</strong> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</p>
<p id='20_05:020'><strong>20.</strong> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p id='20_05:021'><strong>21.</strong> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>
<p id='20_05:022'><strong>22.</strong> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</p>
<p id='20_05:023'><strong>23.</strong> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_6'>Chapter 6</h2>
<p id='20_06:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</p>
<p id='20_06:002'><strong>2.</strong> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p id='20_06:003'><strong>3.</strong> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
<p id='20_06:004'><strong>4.</strong> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p id='20_06:005'><strong>5.</strong> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p id='20_06:006'><strong>6.</strong> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p id='20_06:007'><strong>7.</strong> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p id='20_06:008'><strong>8.</strong> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p id='20_06:009'><strong>9.</strong> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p id='20_06:010'><strong>10.</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p id='20_06:011'><strong>11.</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p id='20_06:012'><strong>12.</strong> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
<p id='20_06:013'><strong>13.</strong> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>
<p id='20_06:014'><strong>14.</strong> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p id='20_06:015'><strong>15.</strong> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p id='20_06:016'><strong>16.</strong> These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</p>
<p id='20_06:017'><strong>17.</strong> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p id='20_06:018'><strong>18.</strong> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p id='20_06:019'><strong>19.</strong> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p id='20_06:020'><strong>20.</strong> My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p id='20_06:021'><strong>21.</strong> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p id='20_06:022'><strong>22.</strong> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p id='20_06:023'><strong>23.</strong> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
<p id='20_06:024'><strong>24.</strong> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p id='20_06:025'><strong>25.</strong> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p id='20_06:026'><strong>26.</strong> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p id='20_06:027'><strong>27.</strong> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p id='20_06:028'><strong>28.</strong> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
<p id='20_06:029'><strong>29.</strong> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p id='20_06:030'><strong>30.</strong> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p id='20_06:031'><strong>31.</strong> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p id='20_06:032'><strong>32.</strong> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>
<p id='20_06:033'><strong>33.</strong> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p id='20_06:034'><strong>34.</strong> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p id='20_06:035'><strong>35.</strong> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_7'>Chapter 7</h2>
<p id='20_07:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p id='20_07:002'><strong>2.</strong> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p id='20_07:003'><strong>3.</strong> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p id='20_07:004'><strong>4.</strong> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</p>
<p id='20_07:005'><strong>5.</strong> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</p>
<p id='20_07:006'><strong>6.</strong> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p id='20_07:007'><strong>7.</strong> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
