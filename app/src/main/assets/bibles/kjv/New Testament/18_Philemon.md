# Philemon <!-- Start Verse Index: 29939 -->

## Chapter 1

**1.** Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, <!-- Index: 29939 -->

**2.** And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: <!-- Index: 29940 -->

**3.** Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <!-- Index: 29941 -->

**4.** I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, <!-- Index: 29942 -->

**5.** Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; <!-- Index: 29943 -->

**6.** That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. <!-- Index: 29944 -->

**7.** For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. <!-- Index: 29945 -->

**8.** Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, <!-- Index: 29946 -->

**9.** Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. <!-- Index: 29947 -->

**10.** I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: <!-- Index: 29948 -->

**11.** Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: <!-- Index: 29949 -->

**12.** Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: <!-- Index: 29950 -->

**13.** Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: <!-- Index: 29951 -->

**14.** But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. <!-- Index: 29952 -->

**15.** For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; <!-- Index: 29953 -->

**16.** Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? <!-- Index: 29954 -->

**17.** If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. <!-- Index: 29955 -->

**18.** If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; <!-- Index: 29956 -->

**19.** I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. <!-- Index: 29957 -->

**20.** Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. <!-- Index: 29958 -->

**21.** Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. <!-- Index: 29959 -->

**22.** But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. <!-- Index: 29960 -->

**23.** There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; <!-- Index: 29961 -->

**24.** Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. <!-- Index: 29962 -->

**25.** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant. <!-- Index: 29963 -->
