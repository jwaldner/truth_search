<h1>II John</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='63_01:001'><strong>1.</strong> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>
<p id='63_01:002'><strong>2.</strong> For the truthâ€™s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>
<p id='63_01:003'><strong>3.</strong> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p id='63_01:004'><strong>4.</strong> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>
<p id='63_01:005'><strong>5.</strong> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p id='63_01:006'><strong>6.</strong> And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>
<p id='63_01:007'><strong>7.</strong> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</p>
<p id='63_01:008'><strong>8.</strong> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
<p id='63_01:009'><strong>9.</strong> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p id='63_01:010'><strong>10.</strong> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>
<p id='63_01:011'><strong>11.</strong> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
<p id='63_01:012'><strong>12.</strong> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>
<p id='63_01:013'><strong>13.</strong> The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
