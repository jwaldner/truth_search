# Proverbs <!-- Start Verse Index: 16401 -->

## Chapter 1

**1.** The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: <!-- Index: 16401 -->

**2.** To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight, <!-- Index: 16402 -->

**3.** to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; <!-- Index: 16403 -->

**4.** to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth — <!-- Index: 16404 -->

**5.** Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance, <!-- Index: 16405 -->

**6.** to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles. <!-- Index: 16406 -->

**7.** The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction. <!-- Index: 16407 -->

**8.** Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and forsake not your mother’s teaching, <!-- Index: 16408 -->

**9.** for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck. <!-- Index: 16409 -->

**10.** My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. <!-- Index: 16410 -->

**11.** If they say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason; <!-- Index: 16411 -->

**12.** like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; <!-- Index: 16412 -->

**13.** we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder; <!-- Index: 16413 -->

**14.** throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse — <!-- Index: 16414 -->

**15.** my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths, <!-- Index: 16415 -->

**16.** for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood. <!-- Index: 16416 -->

**17.** For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird, <!-- Index: 16417 -->

**18.** but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives. <!-- Index: 16418 -->

**19.** Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors. <!-- Index: 16419 -->

**20.** Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice; <!-- Index: 16420 -->

**21.** at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: <!-- Index: 16421 -->

**22.** How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? <!-- Index: 16422 -->

**23.** If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you. <!-- Index: 16423 -->

**24.** Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded, <!-- Index: 16424 -->

**25.** because you have ignored all my counsel would have none of my reproof, <!-- Index: 16425 -->

**26.** I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you, <!-- Index: 16426 -->

**27.** when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. <!-- Index: 16427 -->

**28.** Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me. <!-- Index: 16428 -->

**29.** Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord, <!-- Index: 16429 -->

**30.** would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof, <!-- Index: 16430 -->

**31.** therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices. <!-- Index: 16431 -->

**32.** For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them; <!-- Index: 16432 -->

**33.** but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster. <!-- Index: 16433 -->

## Chapter 2

**1.** My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, <!-- Index: 16434 -->

**2.** making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; <!-- Index: 16435 -->

**3.** yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, <!-- Index: 16436 -->

**4.** if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, <!-- Index: 16437 -->

**5.** then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. <!-- Index: 16438 -->

**6.** For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; <!-- Index: 16439 -->

**7.** he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, <!-- Index: 16440 -->

**8.** guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints. <!-- Index: 16441 -->

**9.** Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; <!-- Index: 16442 -->

**10.** for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; <!-- Index: 16443 -->

**11.** discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, <!-- Index: 16444 -->

**12.** delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech, <!-- Index: 16445 -->

**13.** who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, <!-- Index: 16446 -->

**14.** who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, <!-- Index: 16447 -->

**15.** men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways. <!-- Index: 16448 -->

**16.** So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words, <!-- Index: 16449 -->

**17.** who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; <!-- Index: 16450 -->

**18.** for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed; <!-- Index: 16451 -->

**19.** none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life. <!-- Index: 16452 -->

**20.** So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. <!-- Index: 16453 -->

**21.** For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it, <!-- Index: 16454 -->

**22.** but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it. <!-- Index: 16455 -->

## Chapter 3

**1.** My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, <!-- Index: 16456 -->

**2.** for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. <!-- Index: 16457 -->

**3.** Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. <!-- Index: 16458 -->

**4.** So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man. <!-- Index: 16459 -->

**5.** Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. <!-- Index: 16460 -->

**6.** In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. <!-- Index: 16461 -->

**7.** Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord, and turn away from evil. <!-- Index: 16462 -->

**8.** It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones. <!-- Index: 16463 -->

**9.** Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce; <!-- Index: 16464 -->

**10.** then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine. <!-- Index: 16465 -->

**11.** My son, do not despise the Lord ’s discipline or be weary of his reproof, <!-- Index: 16466 -->

**12.** for the Lord reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights. <!-- Index: 16467 -->

**13.** Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding, <!-- Index: 16468 -->

**14.** for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold. <!-- Index: 16469 -->

**15.** She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her. <!-- Index: 16470 -->

**16.** Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. <!-- Index: 16471 -->

**17.** Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. <!-- Index: 16472 -->

**18.** She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed. <!-- Index: 16473 -->

**19.** The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens; <!-- Index: 16474 -->

**20.** by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew. <!-- Index: 16475 -->

**21.** My son, do not lose sight of these— keep sound wisdom and discretion, <!-- Index: 16476 -->

**22.** and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck. <!-- Index: 16477 -->

**23.** Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble. <!-- Index: 16478 -->

**24.** If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. <!-- Index: 16479 -->

**25.** Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes, <!-- Index: 16480 -->

**26.** for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught. <!-- Index: 16481 -->

**27.** Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it. <!-- Index: 16482 -->

**28.** Do not say to your neighbor, Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it —when you have it with you. <!-- Index: 16483 -->

**29.** Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you. <!-- Index: 16484 -->

**30.** Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm. <!-- Index: 16485 -->

**31.** Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways, <!-- Index: 16486 -->

**32.** for the devious person is an abomination to the Lord, but the upright are in his confidence. <!-- Index: 16487 -->

**33.** The Lord ’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous. <!-- Index: 16488 -->

**34.** Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor. <!-- Index: 16489 -->

**35.** The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace. <!-- Index: 16490 -->

## Chapter 4

**1.** Hear, O sons, a father’s instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight, <!-- Index: 16491 -->

**2.** for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching. <!-- Index: 16492 -->

**3.** When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother, <!-- Index: 16493 -->

**4.** he taught me and said to me, Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live. <!-- Index: 16494 -->

**5.** Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. <!-- Index: 16495 -->

**6.** Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you. <!-- Index: 16496 -->

**7.** The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight. <!-- Index: 16497 -->

**8.** Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her. <!-- Index: 16498 -->

**9.** She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown. <!-- Index: 16499 -->

**10.** Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many. <!-- Index: 16500 -->

**11.** I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness. <!-- Index: 16501 -->

**12.** When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble. <!-- Index: 16502 -->

**13.** Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life. <!-- Index: 16503 -->

**14.** Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil. <!-- Index: 16504 -->

**15.** Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on. <!-- Index: 16505 -->

**16.** For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble. <!-- Index: 16506 -->

**17.** For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. <!-- Index: 16507 -->

**18.** But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. <!-- Index: 16508 -->

**19.** The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know over what they stumble. <!-- Index: 16509 -->

**20.** My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. <!-- Index: 16510 -->

**21.** Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart. <!-- Index: 16511 -->

**22.** For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh. <!-- Index: 16512 -->

**23.** Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life. <!-- Index: 16513 -->

**24.** Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you. <!-- Index: 16514 -->

**25.** Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you. <!-- Index: 16515 -->

**26.** Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure. <!-- Index: 16516 -->

**27.** Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil. <!-- Index: 16517 -->

## Chapter 5

**1.** My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding, <!-- Index: 16518 -->

**2.** that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge. <!-- Index: 16519 -->

**3.** For the lips of a woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, <!-- Index: 16520 -->

**4.** but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. <!-- Index: 16521 -->

**5.** Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol; <!-- Index: 16522 -->

**6.** she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it. <!-- Index: 16523 -->

**7.** And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth. <!-- Index: 16524 -->

**8.** Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house, <!-- Index: 16525 -->

**9.** lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless, <!-- Index: 16526 -->

**10.** lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, <!-- Index: 16527 -->

**11.** and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed, <!-- Index: 16528 -->

**12.** and you say, How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof! <!-- Index: 16529 -->

**13.** I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors. <!-- Index: 16530 -->

**14.** I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation. <!-- Index: 16531 -->

**15.** Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well. <!-- Index: 16532 -->

**16.** Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? <!-- Index: 16533 -->

**17.** Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you. <!-- Index: 16534 -->

**18.** Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, <!-- Index: 16535 -->

**19.** a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love. <!-- Index: 16536 -->

**20.** Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress? <!-- Index: 16537 -->

**21.** For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he ponders all his paths. <!-- Index: 16538 -->

**22.** The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. <!-- Index: 16539 -->

**23.** He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray. <!-- Index: 16540 -->

## Chapter 6

**1.** My son, if you have security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger, <!-- Index: 16541 -->

**2.** if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth, <!-- Index: 16542 -->

**3.** then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor. <!-- Index: 16543 -->

**4.** Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber; <!-- Index: 16544 -->

**5.** save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler. <!-- Index: 16545 -->

**6.** Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. <!-- Index: 16546 -->

**7.** Without having any chief, officer, or ruler, <!-- Index: 16547 -->

**8.** she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest. <!-- Index: 16548 -->

**9.** How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep? <!-- Index: 16549 -->

**10.** A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, <!-- Index: 16550 -->

**11.** and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man. <!-- Index: 16551 -->

**12.** A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, <!-- Index: 16552 -->

**13.** winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger, <!-- Index: 16553 -->

**14.** with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord; <!-- Index: 16554 -->

**15.** therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing. <!-- Index: 16555 -->

**16.** There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: <!-- Index: 16556 -->

**17.** haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, <!-- Index: 16557 -->

**18.** a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, <!-- Index: 16558 -->

**19.** a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. <!-- Index: 16559 -->

**20.** My son, keep your father’s commandment, and forsake not your mother’s teaching. <!-- Index: 16560 -->

**21.** Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck. <!-- Index: 16561 -->

**22.** When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you. <!-- Index: 16562 -->

**23.** For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life, <!-- Index: 16563 -->

**24.** to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress. <!-- Index: 16564 -->

**25.** Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes; <!-- Index: 16565 -->

**26.** for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life. <!-- Index: 16566 -->

**27.** Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned? <!-- Index: 16567 -->

**28.** Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched? <!-- Index: 16568 -->

**29.** So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; none who touches her will go unpunished. <!-- Index: 16569 -->

**30.** People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry, <!-- Index: 16570 -->

**31.** but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house. <!-- Index: 16571 -->

**32.** He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself. <!-- Index: 16572 -->

**33.** He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away. <!-- Index: 16573 -->

**34.** For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge. <!-- Index: 16574 -->

**35.** He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts. <!-- Index: 16575 -->

## Chapter 7

**1.** My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you; <!-- Index: 16576 -->

**2.** keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye; <!-- Index: 16577 -->

**3.** bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. <!-- Index: 16578 -->

**4.** Say to wisdom, You are my sister, and call insight your intimate friend, <!-- Index: 16579 -->

**5.** to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words. <!-- Index: 16580 -->

**6.** For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice, <!-- Index: 16581 -->

**7.** and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense, <!-- Index: 16582 -->

**8.** passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house <!-- Index: 16583 -->

**9.** in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness. <!-- Index: 16584 -->

**10.** And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart. <!-- Index: 16585 -->

**11.** She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home; <!-- Index: 16586 -->

**12.** now in the street, now in the market, at every corner she lies in wait. <!-- Index: 16587 -->

**13.** She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him, <!-- Index: 16588 -->

**14.** I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows; <!-- Index: 16589 -->

**15.** so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you. <!-- Index: 16590 -->

**16.** I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen; <!-- Index: 16591 -->

**17.** I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. <!-- Index: 16592 -->

**18.** Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love. <!-- Index: 16593 -->

**19.** For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey; <!-- Index: 16594 -->

**20.** he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home. <!-- Index: 16595 -->

**21.** With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him. <!-- Index: 16596 -->

**22.** All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast <!-- Index: 16597 -->

**23.** till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life. <!-- Index: 16598 -->

**24.** And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth. <!-- Index: 16599 -->

**25.** Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths, <!-- Index: 16600 -->

**26.** for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng. <!-- Index: 16601 -->

**27.** Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death. <!-- Index: 16602 -->

## Chapter 8

**1.** Does not wisdom call? Does not understanding raise her voice? <!-- Index: 16603 -->

**2.** On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand; <!-- Index: 16604 -->

**3.** beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud: <!-- Index: 16605 -->

**4.** To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man. <!-- Index: 16606 -->

**5.** O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense. <!-- Index: 16607 -->

**6.** Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right, <!-- Index: 16608 -->

**7.** for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips. <!-- Index: 16609 -->

**8.** All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them. <!-- Index: 16610 -->

**9.** They are all straight to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge. <!-- Index: 16611 -->

**10.** Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, <!-- Index: 16612 -->

**11.** for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. <!-- Index: 16613 -->

**12.** I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. <!-- Index: 16614 -->

**13.** The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate. <!-- Index: 16615 -->

**14.** I have counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have strength. <!-- Index: 16616 -->

**15.** By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just; <!-- Index: 16617 -->

**16.** by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly. <!-- Index: 16618 -->

**17.** I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me. <!-- Index: 16619 -->

**18.** Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. <!-- Index: 16620 -->

**19.** My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver. <!-- Index: 16621 -->

**20.** I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice, <!-- Index: 16622 -->

**21.** granting an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries. <!-- Index: 16623 -->

**22.** The Lord possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old. <!-- Index: 16624 -->

**23.** Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth. <!-- Index: 16625 -->

**24.** When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water. <!-- Index: 16626 -->

**25.** Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth, <!-- Index: 16627 -->

**26.** before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world. <!-- Index: 16628 -->

**27.** When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, <!-- Index: 16629 -->

**28.** when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep, <!-- Index: 16630 -->

**29.** when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, <!-- Index: 16631 -->

**30.** then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always, <!-- Index: 16632 -->

**31.** rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man. <!-- Index: 16633 -->

**32.** And now, O sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways. <!-- Index: 16634 -->

**33.** Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. <!-- Index: 16635 -->

**34.** Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. <!-- Index: 16636 -->

**35.** For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord, <!-- Index: 16637 -->

**36.** but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death. <!-- Index: 16638 -->

## Chapter 9

**1.** Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars. <!-- Index: 16639 -->

**2.** She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table. <!-- Index: 16640 -->

**3.** She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town, <!-- Index: 16641 -->

**4.** Whoever is simple, let him turn in here! To him who lacks sense she says, <!-- Index: 16642 -->
