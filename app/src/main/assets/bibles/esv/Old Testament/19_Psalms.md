**2.** Take hold of shield and buckler and rise for my help! <!-- Index: 14412 -->

**3.** Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers! Say to my soul, I am your salvation! <!-- Index: 14413 -->

**10.** All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like you, delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him, the poor and needy from him who robs him? <!-- Index: 14420 -->

**11.** Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I do not know. <!-- Index: 14421 -->

**12.** They repay me evil for good; my soul is bereft. <!-- Index: 14422 -->

**13.** But I, when they were sick — I wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting; I prayed with head bowed on my chest. <!-- Index: 14423 -->

**14.** I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother; as one who laments his mother, I bowed down in mourning. <!-- Index: 14424 -->

**15.** But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered; they gathered together against me; wretches whom I did not know tore at me without ceasing; <!-- Index: 14425 -->

**26.** Let them be put to shame and disappointed altogether who rejoice at my calamity! Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me! <!-- Index: 14436 -->

**27.** Let those who delight in my righteousness shout for joy and be glad and say evermore, Great is the Lord, who delights in the welfare of his servant! <!-- Index: 14437 -->

## Chapter 36

**1.** To the choirmaster. Of David, the servant of the Lord. Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes. <!-- Index: 14439 -->

**2.** For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated. <!-- Index: 14440 -->

**3.** The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good. <!-- Index: 14441 -->

**4.** He plots trouble while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject evil. <!-- Index: 14442 -->

**5.** Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds. <!-- Index: 14443 -->

**6.** Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep; man and beast you save, O Lord. <!-- Index: 14444 -->

**7.** How precious is your steadfast love O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings. <!-- Index: 14445 -->

**8.** They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights. <!-- Index: 14446 -->

**9.** For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light. <!-- Index: 14447 -->

**10.** Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart! <!-- Index: 14448 -->

**12.** The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him, <!-- Index: 14462 -->

**13.** but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming. <!-- Index: 14463 -->

**14.** The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright; <!-- Index: 14464 -->

**15.** their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. <!-- Index: 14465 -->

**16.** Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked. <!-- Index: 14466 -->

**17.** For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous. <!-- Index: 14467 -->

**18.** The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever; <!-- Index: 14468 -->

**19.** they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance. <!-- Index: 14469 -->

**20.** But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the Lord are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish —like smoke they vanish away. <!-- Index: 14470 -->

**21.** The wicked borrows but does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives; <!-- Index: 14471 -->

**22.** for those blessed by the Lord shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off. <!-- Index: 14472 -->

**23.** The steps of a man are established by the Lord, when he delights in his way; <!-- Index: 14473 -->

**24.** though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the Lord upholds his hand. <!-- Index: 14474 -->

**25.** I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread. <!-- Index: 14475 -->

**26.** He is ever lending generously, and his children become a blessing. <!-- Index: 14476 -->

**27.** Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever. <!-- Index: 14477 -->

**28.** For the Lord loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off. <!-- Index: 14478 -->

**29.** The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever. <!-- Index: 14479 -->

**30.** The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice. <!-- Index: 14480 -->

**31.** The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip. <!-- Index: 14481 -->

**32.** The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to put him to death. <!-- Index: 14482 -->

**33.** The Lord will not abandon him to his power or be condemned when he is brought to trial. <!-- Index: 14483 -->

**34.** Wait for the Lord and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off. <!-- Index: 14484 -->

**35.** I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a green laurel tree. <!-- Index: 14485 -->

**36.** But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found. <!-- Index: 14486 -->

**37.** Mark the blameless and behold the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace. <!-- Index: 14487 -->

**40.** The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him. <!-- Index: 14490 -->

## Chapter 38

**1.** A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering. O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath! <!-- Index: 14491 -->

**2.** For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me. <!-- Index: 14492 -->

**3.** There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin. <!-- Index: 14493 -->

**4.** For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. <!-- Index: 14494 -->

**5.** My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness, <!-- Index: 14495 -->

**6.** I am utterly bowed prostrate; all the day I go about mourning. <!-- Index: 14496 -->

**7.** For my sides are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh. <!-- Index: 14497 -->

**8.** I am feeble and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart. <!-- Index: 14498 -->

**9.** O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you. <!-- Index: 14499 -->

**10.** My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes — it also has gone from me. <!-- Index: 14500 -->

**11.** My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my nearest kin stand far off. <!-- Index: 14501 -->

**12.** Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long. <!-- Index: 14502 -->

**13.** But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth. <!-- Index: 14503 -->

**14.** I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes. <!-- Index: 14504 -->

**15.** But for you, O Lord, do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer. <!-- Index: 14505 -->

**16.** For I said, Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips! <!-- Index: 14506 -->

**17.** For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me. <!-- Index: 14507 -->

**18.** I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin. <!-- Index: 14508 -->

## Chapter 39

**1.** To the choirmaster: to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, so long as the wicked are in my presence. <!-- Index: 14513 -->

**2.** I was mute and silent; I held my peace to no avail, and my distress grew worse. <!-- Index: 14514 -->

**3.** My heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue: <!-- Index: 14515 -->

**4.** O Lord, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am! <!-- Index: 14516 -->

**5.** Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Selah <!-- Index: 14517 -->

**6.** Surely a man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather! <!-- Index: 14518 -->

**7.** And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you. <!-- Index: 14519 -->

**8.** Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of the fool! <!-- Index: 14520 -->

**9.** I am mute; I do not open my mouth, for it is you who have done it. <!-- Index: 14521 -->

**10.** Remove your stroke from me; I am spent by the hostility of your hand. <!-- Index: 14522 -->

**11.** When you discipline a man with rebukes for sin, you consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely all mankind is a mere breath! Selah <!-- Index: 14523 -->

**12.** Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears! For I am a sojourner with you, a guest, like all my fathers. <!-- Index: 14524 -->

**13.** Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more! <!-- Index: 14525 -->

## Chapter 40

**1.** To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry. <!-- Index: 14526 -->

**2.** He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure. <!-- Index: 14527 -->

**3.** He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord. <!-- Index: 14528 -->

**4.** Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie! <!-- Index: 14529 -->

**5.** You have multiplied, O Lord my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you! I will proclaim and tell of them, yet they are more than can be told. <!-- Index: 14530 -->

**6.** In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required. <!-- Index: 14531 -->

**7.** Then I said, Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me: <!-- Index: 14532 -->

**8.** I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart. <!-- Index: 14533 -->

**9.** I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O Lord. <!-- Index: 14534 -->

**10.** I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation. <!-- Index: 14535 -->

**11.** As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain your mercy from me; your steadfast love and your faithfulness will ever preserve me! <!-- Index: 14536 -->

**12.** For evils have encompassed me beyond number; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me. <!-- Index: 14537 -->

**13.** Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me! O Lord, make haste to help me! <!-- Index: 14538 -->

**14.** Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt! <!-- Index: 14539 -->

**15.** Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, Aha, Aha! <!-- Index: 14540 -->

**16.** But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, Great is the Lord! <!-- Index: 14541 -->

**17.** As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God! <!-- Index: 14542 -->

## Chapter 41

**1.** To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the Lord delivers him; <!-- Index: 14543 -->

**4.** As for me, I said, O Lord, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you! <!-- Index: 14546 -->

**5.** My enemies say of me in malice, When will he die, and his name perish? <!-- Index: 14547 -->

**6.** And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad. <!-- Index: 14548 -->

**7.** All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me. <!-- Index: 14549 -->

**8.** They say, A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies. <!-- Index: 14550 -->

**9.** Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me. <!-- Index: 14551 -->

**10.** But you, O Lord, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them! <!-- Index: 14552 -->

**11.** By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me. <!-- Index: 14553 -->

**12.** But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever. <!-- Index: 14554 -->

**3.** My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God? <!-- Index: 14558 -->

**4.** These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival. <!-- Index: 14559 -->

**5.** Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation <!-- Index: 14560 -->

**6.** and my God. My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar. <!-- Index: 14561 -->

**7.** Deep calls to deep at the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your waves have gone over me. <!-- Index: 14562 -->

**8.** By day the Lord commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life. <!-- Index: 14563 -->

**9.** I say to God, my rock: Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? <!-- Index: 14564 -->

**10.** As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God? <!-- Index: 14565 -->

**2.** you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free; <!-- Index: 14573 -->

**3.** for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm save them, but your right hand and your arm, and the light of your face, for you delighted in them. <!-- Index: 14574 -->

**4.** You are my King, O God; ordain salvation for Jacob! <!-- Index: 14575 -->

**5.** Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down those who rise up against us. <!-- Index: 14576 -->

**6.** For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me. <!-- Index: 14577 -->

**7.** But you have saved us from our foes and have put to shame those who hate us. <!-- Index: 14578 -->

**8.** In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah <!-- Index: 14579 -->

**9.** But you have rejected us and disgraced us and have not gone out with our armies. <!-- Index: 14580 -->

**10.** You have made us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have gotten spoil. <!-- Index: 14581 -->

**11.** You have made us like sheep for slaughter and have scattered us among the nations. <!-- Index: 14582 -->

**12.** You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them. <!-- Index: 14583 -->

**13.** You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us. <!-- Index: 14584 -->

**14.** You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples. <!-- Index: 14585 -->

**15.** All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face <!-- Index: 14586 -->

**16.** at the sound of the taunter and reviler, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger. <!-- Index: 14587 -->

**17.** All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant. <!-- Index: 14588 -->

**18.** Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way; <!-- Index: 14589 -->

**19.** yet you have broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death. <!-- Index: 14590 -->

**20.** If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god, <!-- Index: 14591 -->

**21.** would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart. <!-- Index: 14592 -->

**22.** Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. <!-- Index: 14593 -->

**23.** Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever! <!-- Index: 14594 -->

**24.** Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression? <!-- Index: 14595 -->

**25.** For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the ground. <!-- Index: 14596 -->

**26.** Rise up; come to our help! Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love! <!-- Index: 14597 -->

**3.** Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress. <!-- Index: 14637 -->

**4.** For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together. <!-- Index: 14638 -->

**4.** I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre. <!-- Index: 14652 -->

**6.** those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches? <!-- Index: 14654 -->

**7.** Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life, <!-- Index: 14655 -->

**8.** for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice, <!-- Index: 14656 -->

**9.** that he should live on forever and never see the pit. <!-- Index: 14657 -->

**12.** Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish. <!-- Index: 14660 -->

**13.** This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah <!-- Index: 14661 -->

**14.** Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell. <!-- Index: 14662 -->

**7.** Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God. <!-- Index: 14675 -->

**8.** Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me. <!-- Index: 14676 -->

**9.** I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds. <!-- Index: 14677 -->

**12.** If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine. <!-- Index: 14680 -->

**13.** Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? <!-- Index: 14681 -->

**14.** Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High, <!-- Index: 14682 -->

**15.** and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me. <!-- Index: 14683 -->

**16.** But to the wicked God says: What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips? <!-- Index: 14684 -->

**17.** For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you. <!-- Index: 14685 -->

**18.** If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers. <!-- Index: 14686 -->

**19.** You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit. <!-- Index: 14687 -->

**20.** You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son. <!-- Index: 14688 -->

**21.** These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you. <!-- Index: 14689 -->

**22.** Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver! <!-- Index: 14690 -->

**3.** For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. <!-- Index: 14694 -->

**4.** Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment. <!-- Index: 14695 -->

**6.** Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart. <!-- Index: 14697 -->

**7.** Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. <!-- Index: 14698 -->

**8.** Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice. <!-- Index: 14699 -->

**9.** Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. <!-- Index: 14700 -->

**15.** O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. <!-- Index: 14706 -->

**16.** For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering. <!-- Index: 14707 -->

**17.** The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. <!-- Index: 14708 -->

**18.** Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem; <!-- Index: 14709 -->

**19.** then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar. <!-- Index: 14710 -->

## Chapter 52

**1.** To the choirmaster. A Maskil of David, when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, David has come to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day. <!-- Index: 14711 -->

**2.** Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit. <!-- Index: 14712 -->

**3.** You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah <!-- Index: 14713 -->

**4.** You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue. <!-- Index: 14714 -->

**5.** But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah <!-- Index: 14715 -->

**6.** The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying, <!-- Index: 14716 -->

**7.** See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction! <!-- Index: 14717 -->

**8.** But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever. <!-- Index: 14718 -->

## Chapter 53

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Mahalath. A Maskil of David. The fool says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good. <!-- Index: 14720 -->

**2.** God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God. <!-- Index: 14721 -->

**3.** They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one. <!-- Index: 14722 -->

**4.** Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God? <!-- Index: 14723 -->

**5.** There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them. <!-- Index: 14724 -->

**6.** Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. <!-- Index: 14725 -->

## Chapter 54

**1.** To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, Is not David hiding among us? O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might. <!-- Index: 14726 -->

**2.** O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. <!-- Index: 14727 -->

**3.** For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah <!-- Index: 14728 -->

**4.** Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life. <!-- Index: 14729 -->

**5.** He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them. <!-- Index: 14730 -->

**6.** With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good. <!-- Index: 14731 -->

**7.** For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies. <!-- Index: 14732 -->

## Chapter 55

**1.** To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy! <!-- Index: 14733 -->

**2.** Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan, <!-- Index: 14734 -->

**3.** because of the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me, and in anger they bear a grudge against me. <!-- Index: 14735 -->

**4.** My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me. <!-- Index: 14736 -->

**5.** Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me. <!-- Index: 14737 -->

**6.** And I say, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest; <!-- Index: 14738 -->

**7.** yes, I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah <!-- Index: 14739 -->

**8.** I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest. <!-- Index: 14740 -->

**9.** Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city. <!-- Index: 14741 -->

**10.** Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it; <!-- Index: 14742 -->

**11.** ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace. <!-- Index: 14743 -->

**12.** For it is not an enemy who taunts me— then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me— then I could hide from him. <!-- Index: 14744 -->

**13.** But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend. <!-- Index: 14745 -->

**14.** We used to take sweet counsel together; within God’s house we walked in the throng. <!-- Index: 14746 -->

**15.** Let death steal over them; let them go down to Sheol alive; for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart. <!-- Index: 14747 -->

**16.** But I call to God, and the Lord will save me. <!-- Index: 14748 -->

**17.** Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he hears my voice. <!-- Index: 14749 -->

**18.** He redeems my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me. <!-- Index: 14750 -->

**19.** God will give ear and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old, Selah because they do not change and do not fear God. <!-- Index: 14751 -->

**20.** My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant. <!-- Index: 14752 -->

**21.** His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords. <!-- Index: 14753 -->

**22.** Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved. <!-- Index: 14754 -->

**23.** But you, O God, will cast them down into the pit of destruction; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you. <!-- Index: 14755 -->

## Chapter 56

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths. A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me; <!-- Index: 14756 -->

**2.** my enemies trample on me all day long, for many attack me proudly. <!-- Index: 14757 -->

**3.** When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. <!-- Index: 14758 -->

**4.** In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? <!-- Index: 14759 -->

**5.** All day long they injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil. <!-- Index: 14760 -->

**6.** They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life. <!-- Index: 14761 -->

**7.** For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples, O God! <!-- Index: 14762 -->

**8.** You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book? <!-- Index: 14763 -->

**9.** Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me. <!-- Index: 14764 -->

**10.** In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise, <!-- Index: 14765 -->

**11.** in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me? <!-- Index: 14766 -->

**12.** I must perform my vows to you, O God; I will render thank offerings to you. <!-- Index: 14767 -->

**13.** For you have delivered my soul from death, yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life. <!-- Index: 14768 -->

## Chapter 57

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by. <!-- Index: 14769 -->

**2.** I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me. <!-- Index: 14770 -->

**3.** He will send from heaven and save me; he will put to shame him who tramples on me. Selah God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness! <!-- Index: 14771 -->

**4.** My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts — the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. <!-- Index: 14772 -->

**5.** Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth! <!-- Index: 14773 -->

**6.** They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah <!-- Index: 14774 -->

**7.** My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody! <!-- Index: 14775 -->

**8.** Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn! <!-- Index: 14776 -->

**9.** I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. <!-- Index: 14777 -->

**10.** For your steadfast love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds. <!-- Index: 14778 -->

**11.** Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth! <!-- Index: 14779 -->

## Chapter 58

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David. Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly? <!-- Index: 14780 -->

**2.** No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth. <!-- Index: 14781 -->

**3.** The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies. <!-- Index: 14782 -->

**4.** They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear, <!-- Index: 14783 -->

**5.** so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter. <!-- Index: 14784 -->

**6.** O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord! <!-- Index: 14785 -->

**7.** Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted. <!-- Index: 14786 -->

**8.** Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun. <!-- Index: 14787 -->

**9.** Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away! <!-- Index: 14788 -->

**10.** The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked. <!-- Index: 14789 -->

**11.** Mankind will say, Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth. <!-- Index: 14790 -->

**2.** deliver me from those who work evil, and save me from bloodthirsty men. <!-- Index: 14792 -->

**3.** For behold, they lie in wait for my life; fierce men stir up strife against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O Lord, <!-- Index: 14793 -->

**4.** for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Awake, come to meet me, and see! <!-- Index: 14794 -->

**5.** You, Lord God of hosts, are God of Israel. Rouse yourself to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah <!-- Index: 14795 -->

**6.** Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city. <!-- Index: 14796 -->

**7.** There they are, bellowing with their mouths with swords in their lips — for Who, they think, will hear us? <!-- Index: 14797 -->

**8.** But you, O Lord, laugh at them; you hold all the nations in derision. <!-- Index: 14798 -->

**9.** O my Strength, I will watch for you, for you, O God, are my fortress. <!-- Index: 14799 -->

**10.** My God in his steadfast love will meet me; God will let me look in triumph on my enemies. <!-- Index: 14800 -->

**11.** Kill them not, lest my people forget; make them totter by your power and bring them down, O Lord, our shield! <!-- Index: 14801 -->

**12.** For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter, <!-- Index: 14802 -->

**13.** consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, that they may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah <!-- Index: 14803 -->

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Shushan Eduth. A Miktam of David; for instruction; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and when Joab on his return struck down twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us. <!-- Index: 14808 -->

**2.** You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters. <!-- Index: 14809 -->

**3.** You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger. <!-- Index: 14810 -->

**4.** You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow. Selah <!-- Index: 14811 -->

**5.** That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us! <!-- Index: 14812 -->

**6.** God has spoken in his holiness: With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth. <!-- Index: 14813 -->

**7.** Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter. <!-- Index: 14814 -->

**8.** Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph. <!-- Index: 14815 -->

**9.** Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? <!-- Index: 14816 -->

**10.** Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth, O God, with our armies. <!-- Index: 14817 -->

**11.** Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! <!-- Index: 14818 -->

**12.** With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes. <!-- Index: 14819 -->

**1.** To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer; <!-- Index: 14820 -->

**4.** Let me dwell in your tent forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings! Selah <!-- Index: 14823 -->

**3.** How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence? <!-- Index: 14830 -->

**4.** They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah <!-- Index: 14831 -->

**6.** He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken. <!-- Index: 14833 -->

**7.** On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God. <!-- Index: 14834 -->

**9.** Those of low estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath. <!-- Index: 14836 -->

**10.** Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them. <!-- Index: 14837 -->

**11.** Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God, <!-- Index: 14838 -->

**12.** and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work. <!-- Index: 14839 -->

## Chapter 63

**1.** A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. <!-- Index: 14840 -->

**2.** So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. <!-- Index: 14841 -->

**3.** Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you. <!-- Index: 14842 -->

**5.** My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips, <!-- Index: 14844 -->

**3.** who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows, <!-- Index: 14853 -->

**4.** shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear. <!-- Index: 14854 -->

**5.** They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, Who can see them? <!-- Index: 14855 -->

**6.** They search out injustice, saying, We have accomplished a diligent search. For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep. <!-- Index: 14856 -->

**7.** But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly. <!-- Index: 14857 -->

**8.** They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them; all who see them will wag their heads. <!-- Index: 14858 -->

**9.** Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and ponder what he has done. <!-- Index: 14859 -->

**6.** He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him, <!-- Index: 14879 -->

**7.** who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations — let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah <!-- Index: 14880 -->

**8.** Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard, <!-- Index: 14881 -->

**9.** who has kept our soul among the living and has not let our feet slip. <!-- Index: 14882 -->

**10.** For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried. <!-- Index: 14883 -->

**11.** You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs; <!-- Index: 14884 -->

**12.** you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance. <!-- Index: 14885 -->

**13.** I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will perform my vows to you, <!-- Index: 14886 -->

**14.** that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble. <!-- Index: 14887 -->

**6.** God settles the solitary in a home; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a parched land. <!-- Index: 14906 -->

**7.** O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, Selah <!-- Index: 14907 -->

**8.** the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. <!-- Index: 14908 -->

**9.** Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished; <!-- Index: 14909 -->

**10.** your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy. <!-- Index: 14910 -->

**11.** The Lord gives the word; the women who announce the news are a great host: <!-- Index: 14911 -->

**12.** The kings of the armies —they flee, they flee! The women at home divide the spoil — <!-- Index: 14912 -->

**13.** though you men lie among the sheepfolds — the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with shimmering gold. <!-- Index: 14913 -->

**14.** When the Almighty scatters kings there, let snow fall on Zalmon. <!-- Index: 14914 -->

**15.** O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan! <!-- Index: 14915 -->

**24.** Your procession is seen, O God, the procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary — <!-- Index: 14924 -->

**26.** Bless God in the great congregation, the Lord, O you who are of Israel’s fountain! <!-- Index: 14926 -->

**27.** There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. <!-- Index: 14927 -->

**28.** Summon your power, O God, the power, O God, by which you have worked for us. <!-- Index: 14928 -->

## Chapter 69

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. Of David. Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck. <!-- Index: 14936 -->

**2.** I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me. <!-- Index: 14937 -->

**3.** I am weary with my crying out; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God. <!-- Index: 14938 -->

**4.** More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me with lies. What I did not steal must I now restore? <!-- Index: 14939 -->

**5.** O God, you know my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you. <!-- Index: 14940 -->

**6.** Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, O Lord God of hosts; let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel. <!-- Index: 14941 -->

**7.** For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that dishonor has covered my face. <!-- Index: 14942 -->

**8.** I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s sons. <!-- Index: 14943 -->

**9.** For zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me. <!-- Index: 14944 -->

**10.** When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach. <!-- Index: 14945 -->

**11.** When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them. <!-- Index: 14946 -->

**12.** I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards songs about me. <!-- Index: 14947 -->

**13.** But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness. <!-- Index: 14948 -->

**14.** Deliver me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters. <!-- Index: 14949 -->

**15.** Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me. <!-- Index: 14950 -->

**16.** Answer me, O Lord, for your steadfast love is good; according to your abundant mercy, turn to me. <!-- Index: 14951 -->

**17.** Hide not your face from your servant; for I am in distress; make haste to answer me. <!-- Index: 14952 -->

**18.** Draw near to my soul, redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies! <!-- Index: 14953 -->

**19.** You know my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to you. <!-- Index: 14954 -->

**20.** Reproaches have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none. <!-- Index: 14955 -->

**21.** They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink. <!-- Index: 14956 -->

**22.** Let their own table before them become a snare; and when they are at peace, let it become a trap. <!-- Index: 14957 -->

**23.** Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually. <!-- Index: 14958 -->

**24.** Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them. <!-- Index: 14959 -->

**25.** May their camp be a desolation; let no one dwell in their tents. <!-- Index: 14960 -->

**26.** For they persecute him whom you have struck down, and they recount the pain of those you have wounded. <!-- Index: 14961 -->

**27.** Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you. <!-- Index: 14962 -->

**28.** Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous. <!-- Index: 14963 -->

**29.** But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation, O God, set me on high! <!-- Index: 14964 -->

**30.** I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving. <!-- Index: 14965 -->

**31.** This will please the Lord more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs. <!-- Index: 14966 -->

**32.** When the humble see it they will be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive. <!-- Index: 14967 -->

**33.** For the Lord hears the needy and does not despise his own people who are prisoners. <!-- Index: 14968 -->

**34.** Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them. <!-- Index: 14969 -->

**35.** For God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah, and people shall dwell there and possess it; <!-- Index: 14970 -->

**36.** the offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it. <!-- Index: 14971 -->

## Chapter 70

**1.** To the choirmaster. Of David, for the memorial offering. Make haste, O God, to deliver me! O Lord, make haste to help me! <!-- Index: 14972 -->

**2.** Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt! <!-- Index: 14973 -->

**3.** Let them turn back because of their shame who say, Aha, Aha! <!-- Index: 14974 -->

**4.** May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, God is great! <!-- Index: 14975 -->

**2.** In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline your ear to me, and save me! <!-- Index: 14978 -->

**3.** Be to me a rock of refuge, to which I may continually come; you have given the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress. <!-- Index: 14979 -->

**4.** Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man. <!-- Index: 14980 -->

**5.** For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O Lord, from my youth. <!-- Index: 14981 -->

**6.** Upon you I have leaned from before my birth; you are he who took me from my mother’s womb. My praise is continually of you. <!-- Index: 14982 -->

**7.** I have been as a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge. <!-- Index: 14983 -->

**8.** My mouth is filled with your praise, and with your glory all the day. <!-- Index: 14984 -->

**9.** Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent. <!-- Index: 14985 -->

**10.** For my enemies speak concerning me; those who watch for my life consult together <!-- Index: 14986 -->

**11.** and say, God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him. <!-- Index: 14987 -->

**12.** O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me! <!-- Index: 14988 -->

**13.** May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt. <!-- Index: 14989 -->

**14.** But I will hope continually and will praise you yet more and more. <!-- Index: 14990 -->

**15.** My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge. <!-- Index: 14991 -->

**16.** With the mighty deeds of the Lord God I will come; I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone. <!-- Index: 14992 -->

**17.** O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds. <!-- Index: 14993 -->

**18.** So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim your might to another generation, your power to all those to come. <!-- Index: 14994 -->

**19.** Your righteousness, O God, reaches the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you? <!-- Index: 14995 -->

**20.** You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again. <!-- Index: 14996 -->

**21.** You will increase my greatness and comfort me again. <!-- Index: 14997 -->

**22.** I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel. <!-- Index: 14998 -->

**23.** My lips will shout for joy, when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have redeemed. <!-- Index: 14999 -->

**24.** And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt. <!-- Index: 15000 -->

## Chapter 72

## Chapter 73

**1.** A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. <!-- Index: 15021 -->

**2.** But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped. <!-- Index: 15022 -->

**3.** For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <!-- Index: 15023 -->

**4.** For they have no pangs until death; their bodies are fat and sleek. <!-- Index: 15024 -->

**5.** They are not in trouble as others are; they are not stricken like the rest of mankind. <!-- Index: 15025 -->

**6.** Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment. <!-- Index: 15026 -->

**7.** Their eyes swell out through fatness; their hearts overflow with follies. <!-- Index: 15027 -->

**8.** They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression. <!-- Index: 15028 -->

**9.** They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth. <!-- Index: 15029 -->

**10.** Therefore his people turn back to them, and find no fault in them. <!-- Index: 15030 -->

**11.** And they say, How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High? <!-- Index: 15031 -->

**12.** Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches. <!-- Index: 15032 -->

**13.** All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence. <!-- Index: 15033 -->

**14.** For all the day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning. <!-- Index: 15034 -->

**15.** If I had said, I will speak thus, I would have betrayed the generation of your children. <!-- Index: 15035 -->

**16.** But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task, <!-- Index: 15036 -->

**17.** until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end. <!-- Index: 15037 -->

**18.** Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin. <!-- Index: 15038 -->

**19.** How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors! <!-- Index: 15039 -->

**20.** Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms. <!-- Index: 15040 -->

**21.** When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart, <!-- Index: 15041 -->

**22.** I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. <!-- Index: 15042 -->

**23.** Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. <!-- Index: 15043 -->

**24.** You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. <!-- Index: 15044 -->

**25.** Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you. <!-- Index: 15045 -->

**26.** My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. <!-- Index: 15046 -->

**27.** For behold, those who are far from you shall perish; you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you. <!-- Index: 15047 -->

**28.** But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all your works. <!-- Index: 15048 -->

## Chapter 74

**1.** A Maskil of Asaph. O God, why do you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture? <!-- Index: 15049 -->

**2.** Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage! Remember Mount Zion, where you have dwelt. <!-- Index: 15050 -->

**3.** Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary! <!-- Index: 15051 -->

**4.** Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place; they set up their own signs for signs. <!-- Index: 15052 -->

**5.** They were like those who swing axes in a forest of trees. <!-- Index: 15053 -->

**6.** And all its carved wood they broke down with hatchets and hammers. <!-- Index: 15054 -->

**7.** They set your sanctuary on fire; they profaned the dwelling place of your name, bringing it down to the ground. <!-- Index: 15055 -->

**8.** They said to themselves, We will utterly subdue them; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land. <!-- Index: 15056 -->

**9.** We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and there is none among us who knows how long. <!-- Index: 15057 -->

**10.** How long, O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile your name forever? <!-- Index: 15058 -->

**11.** Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the fold of your garment and destroy them! <!-- Index: 15059 -->

**12.** Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. <!-- Index: 15060 -->

**13.** You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters. <!-- Index: 15061 -->

**14.** You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness. <!-- Index: 15062 -->

**15.** You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams. <!-- Index: 15063 -->

**16.** Yours is the day, yours also the night; you have established the heavenly lights and the sun. <!-- Index: 15064 -->

**17.** You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you have made summer and winter. <!-- Index: 15065 -->

**18.** Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy scoffs, and a foolish people reviles your name. <!-- Index: 15066 -->

**19.** Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of your poor forever. <!-- Index: 15067 -->

**20.** Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. <!-- Index: 15068 -->

**21.** Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name. <!-- Index: 15069 -->

**22.** Arise, O God, defend your cause; remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day! <!-- Index: 15070 -->

**23.** Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of those who rise against you, which goes up continually! <!-- Index: 15071 -->

## Chapter 75

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds. <!-- Index: 15072 -->

**2.** At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity. <!-- Index: 15073 -->

**3.** When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah <!-- Index: 15074 -->

**4.** I say to the boastful, Do not boast, and to the wicked, Do not lift up your horn; <!-- Index: 15075 -->

**5.** do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck. <!-- Index: 15076 -->

**6.** For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up, <!-- Index: 15077 -->

**7.** but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another. <!-- Index: 15078 -->

**8.** For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs. <!-- Index: 15079 -->

**9.** But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. <!-- Index: 15080 -->

**10.** All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. <!-- Index: 15081 -->

## Chapter 76

**1.** To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel. <!-- Index: 15082 -->

**2.** His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. <!-- Index: 15083 -->

**3.** There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah <!-- Index: 15084 -->

**4.** Glorious are you, more majestic than the mountains full of prey. <!-- Index: 15085 -->

**5.** The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands. <!-- Index: 15086 -->

**6.** At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, rider and horse lay stunned. <!-- Index: 15087 -->

**7.** But you, you are to be feared! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused? <!-- Index: 15088 -->

**8.** From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still, <!-- Index: 15089 -->

**9.** when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah <!-- Index: 15090 -->

**10.** Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt. <!-- Index: 15091 -->

**11.** Make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared, <!-- Index: 15092 -->

**12.** who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth. <!-- Index: 15093 -->

## Chapter 77

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me. <!-- Index: 15094 -->

**2.** In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted. <!-- Index: 15095 -->

**3.** When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah <!-- Index: 15096 -->

**4.** You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. <!-- Index: 15097 -->

**5.** I consider the days of old, the years long ago. <!-- Index: 15098 -->

**6.** I said, Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart. Then my spirit made a diligent search: <!-- Index: 15099 -->

**7.** Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable? <!-- Index: 15100 -->

**8.** Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time? <!-- Index: 15101 -->

**9.** Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion? Selah <!-- Index: 15102 -->

**10.** Then I said, I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High. <!-- Index: 15103 -->

**11.** I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your wonders of old. <!-- Index: 15104 -->

**12.** I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds. <!-- Index: 15105 -->

**13.** Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God? <!-- Index: 15106 -->

**14.** You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples. <!-- Index: 15107 -->

**15.** You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah <!-- Index: 15108 -->

**16.** When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled. <!-- Index: 15109 -->

**17.** The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side. <!-- Index: 15110 -->

**18.** The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook. <!-- Index: 15111 -->

**19.** Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen. <!-- Index: 15112 -->

**20.** You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. <!-- Index: 15113 -->

## Chapter 78

**1.** A Maskil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth! <!-- Index: 15114 -->

**2.** I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old, <!-- Index: 15115 -->

**3.** things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us. <!-- Index: 15116 -->

**4.** We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders that he has done. <!-- Index: 15117 -->

**5.** He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children, <!-- Index: 15118 -->

**6.** that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children, <!-- Index: 15119 -->

**7.** so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments; <!-- Index: 15120 -->

**8.** and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God. <!-- Index: 15121 -->

**9.** The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle. <!-- Index: 15122 -->

**10.** They did not keep God’s covenant, but refused to walk according to his law. <!-- Index: 15123 -->

**11.** They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them. <!-- Index: 15124 -->

**12.** In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. <!-- Index: 15125 -->

**13.** He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap. <!-- Index: 15126 -->

**14.** In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light. <!-- Index: 15127 -->

**15.** He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep. <!-- Index: 15128 -->

**16.** He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers. <!-- Index: 15129 -->

**17.** Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert. <!-- Index: 15130 -->

**18.** They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved. <!-- Index: 15131 -->

**19.** They spoke against God, saying, Can God spread a table in the wilderness? <!-- Index: 15132 -->

**20.** He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people? <!-- Index: 15133 -->

**21.** Therefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel, <!-- Index: 15134 -->

**22.** because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power. <!-- Index: 15135 -->

**23.** Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven, <!-- Index: 15136 -->

**24.** and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven. <!-- Index: 15137 -->

**25.** Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance. <!-- Index: 15138 -->

**26.** He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind; <!-- Index: 15139 -->

**27.** he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas; <!-- Index: 15140 -->

**28.** he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings. <!-- Index: 15141 -->

**29.** And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved. <!-- Index: 15142 -->

**30.** But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths, <!-- Index: 15143 -->

**31.** the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel. <!-- Index: 15144 -->

**32.** In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe. <!-- Index: 15145 -->

**33.** So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror. <!-- Index: 15146 -->

**34.** When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly. <!-- Index: 15147 -->

**35.** They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer. <!-- Index: 15148 -->

**36.** But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues. <!-- Index: 15149 -->

**37.** Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant. <!-- Index: 15150 -->

**38.** Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath. <!-- Index: 15151 -->

**39.** He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again. <!-- Index: 15152 -->

**40.** How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert! <!-- Index: 15153 -->

**41.** They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel. <!-- Index: 15154 -->

**42.** They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe, <!-- Index: 15155 -->

**43.** when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan. <!-- Index: 15156 -->

**44.** He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams. <!-- Index: 15157 -->

**45.** He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them. <!-- Index: 15158 -->

**46.** He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust. <!-- Index: 15159 -->

**47.** He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost. <!-- Index: 15160 -->

**48.** He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts. <!-- Index: 15161 -->

**49.** He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels. <!-- Index: 15162 -->

**50.** He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague. <!-- Index: 15163 -->

**51.** He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham. <!-- Index: 15164 -->

**52.** Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. <!-- Index: 15165 -->

**53.** He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. <!-- Index: 15166 -->

**54.** And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won. <!-- Index: 15167 -->

**55.** He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. <!-- Index: 15168 -->

**56.** Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies, <!-- Index: 15169 -->

**57.** but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow. <!-- Index: 15170 -->

**58.** For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols. <!-- Index: 15171 -->

**59.** When God heard, he was wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel. <!-- Index: 15172 -->

**60.** He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind, <!-- Index: 15173 -->

**61.** and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe. <!-- Index: 15174 -->

**62.** He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage. <!-- Index: 15175 -->

**63.** Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song. <!-- Index: 15176 -->

**64.** Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation. <!-- Index: 15177 -->

**65.** Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine. <!-- Index: 15178 -->

**66.** And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame. <!-- Index: 15179 -->

**67.** He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, <!-- Index: 15180 -->

**68.** but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves. <!-- Index: 15181 -->

**69.** He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever. <!-- Index: 15182 -->

**70.** He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds; <!-- Index: 15183 -->

**71.** from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance. <!-- Index: 15184 -->

**72.** With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand. <!-- Index: 15185 -->

## Chapter 79

**1.** A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins. <!-- Index: 15186 -->

**2.** They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth. <!-- Index: 15187 -->

**3.** They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them. <!-- Index: 15188 -->

**4.** We have a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us. <!-- Index: 15189 -->

**5.** How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? <!-- Index: 15190 -->

**6.** Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name! <!-- Index: 15191 -->

**7.** For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation. <!-- Index: 15192 -->

**8.** Do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low. <!-- Index: 15193 -->

**9.** Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and atone for our sins, for your name’s sake! <!-- Index: 15194 -->

**10.** Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes! <!-- Index: 15195 -->

**11.** Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power, preserve those doomed to die! <!-- Index: 15196 -->

**12.** Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord! <!-- Index: 15197 -->

**13.** But we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise. <!-- Index: 15198 -->

## Chapter 80

**1.** To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Testimony. Of Asaph, a Psalm. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. <!-- Index: 15199 -->

**3.** Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved! <!-- Index: 15201 -->

**4.** O Lord God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people’s prayers? <!-- Index: 15202 -->

**5.** You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure. <!-- Index: 15203 -->

**6.** You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves. <!-- Index: 15204 -->

**7.** Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved! <!-- Index: 15205 -->

**8.** You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it. <!-- Index: 15206 -->

**9.** You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land. <!-- Index: 15207 -->

**10.** The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. <!-- Index: 15208 -->

**11.** It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River. <!-- Index: 15209 -->

**12.** Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit? <!-- Index: 15210 -->

**13.** The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it. <!-- Index: 15211 -->

**14.** Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine, <!-- Index: 15212 -->

**15.** the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself. <!-- Index: 15213 -->

**16.** They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face! <!-- Index: 15214 -->

**17.** But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself! <!-- Index: 15215 -->

**18.** Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name! <!-- Index: 15216 -->

**19.** Restore us, O Lord God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved! <!-- Index: 15217 -->

**3.** Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. <!-- Index: 15220 -->

**4.** For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob. <!-- Index: 15221 -->

**5.** He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known: <!-- Index: 15222 -->

**6.** I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket. <!-- Index: 15223 -->

**7.** In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah <!-- Index: 15224 -->

**8.** Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me! <!-- Index: 15225 -->

**9.** There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god. <!-- Index: 15226 -->

**11.** My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass. <!-- Index: 15532 -->

**13.** You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come. <!-- Index: 15534 -->

**16.** for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. <!-- Index: 15565 -->

**17.** But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children, <!-- Index: 15566 -->

**18.** to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. <!-- Index: 15567 -->

**19.** The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. <!-- Index: 15568 -->

## Chapter 104

**1.** Bless the Lord, O my soul! O Lord my God, you are very great! You are clothed with splendor and majesty, <!-- Index: 15572 -->

**2.** covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent. <!-- Index: 15573 -->

**3.** He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters; he makes the clouds his chariot; he rides on the wings of the wind; <!-- Index: 15574 -->

**4.** he makes his messengers winds, his ministers a flaming fire. <!-- Index: 15575 -->

**5.** He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved. <!-- Index: 15576 -->

**6.** You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. <!-- Index: 15577 -->

**7.** At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they took to flight. <!-- Index: 15578 -->

**8.** The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place that you appointed for them. <!-- Index: 15579 -->

**9.** You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth. <!-- Index: 15580 -->

**10.** You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills; <!-- Index: 15581 -->

**11.** they give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. <!-- Index: 15582 -->

**12.** Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches. <!-- Index: 15583 -->

**13.** From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work. <!-- Index: 15584 -->

**14.** You cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth <!-- Index: 15585 -->

**15.** and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man’s heart. <!-- Index: 15586 -->

**16.** The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted. <!-- Index: 15587 -->

**17.** In them the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees. <!-- Index: 15588 -->

**18.** The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers. <!-- Index: 15589 -->

**19.** He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting. <!-- Index: 15590 -->

**20.** You make darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep about. <!-- Index: 15591 -->

**21.** The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God. <!-- Index: 15592 -->

**22.** When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down in their dens. <!-- Index: 15593 -->

**23.** Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening. <!-- Index: 15594 -->

**24.** O Lord, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures. <!-- Index: 15595 -->

**25.** Here is the sea, great and wide, which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great. <!-- Index: 15596 -->

**26.** There go the ships, and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it. <!-- Index: 15597 -->

**27.** These all look to you, to give them their food in due season. <!-- Index: 15598 -->

**28.** When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things. <!-- Index: 15599 -->

**29.** When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust. <!-- Index: 15600 -->

**30.** When you send forth your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground. <!-- Index: 15601 -->

**31.** May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in his works, <!-- Index: 15602 -->

**32.** who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke! <!-- Index: 15603 -->

**33.** I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being. <!-- Index: 15604 -->

**34.** May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the Lord. <!-- Index: 15605 -->

**8.** He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, <!-- Index: 15614 -->

**9.** the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, <!-- Index: 15615 -->

**10.** which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, <!-- Index: 15616 -->

**11.** saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance. <!-- Index: 15617 -->

**12.** When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it, <!-- Index: 15618 -->

**13.** wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people, <!-- Index: 15619 -->

**14.** he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account, <!-- Index: 15620 -->

**15.** saying, Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm! <!-- Index: 15621 -->

**16.** When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread, <!-- Index: 15622 -->

**17.** he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. <!-- Index: 15623 -->

**18.** His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron; <!-- Index: 15624 -->

**19.** until what he had said came to pass, the word of the Lord tested him. <!-- Index: 15625 -->

**20.** The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free; <!-- Index: 15626 -->

**21.** he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions, <!-- Index: 15627 -->

**22.** to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom. <!-- Index: 15628 -->

**23.** Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. <!-- Index: 15629 -->

**24.** And the Lord made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes. <!-- Index: 15630 -->

**25.** He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants. <!-- Index: 15631 -->

**26.** He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. <!-- Index: 15632 -->

**27.** They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham. <!-- Index: 15633 -->

**28.** He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words. <!-- Index: 15634 -->

**29.** He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die. <!-- Index: 15635 -->

**30.** Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. <!-- Index: 15636 -->

**31.** He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country. <!-- Index: 15637 -->

**32.** He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land. <!-- Index: 15638 -->

**33.** He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country. <!-- Index: 15639 -->

**34.** He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number, <!-- Index: 15640 -->

**35.** which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground. <!-- Index: 15641 -->

**36.** He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength. <!-- Index: 15642 -->

**37.** Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled. <!-- Index: 15643 -->

**38.** Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it. <!-- Index: 15644 -->

**39.** He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night. <!-- Index: 15645 -->

**40.** They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance. <!-- Index: 15646 -->

**41.** He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river. <!-- Index: 15647 -->

**42.** For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant. <!-- Index: 15648 -->

**43.** So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing. <!-- Index: 15649 -->

**44.** And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples ’ toil, <!-- Index: 15650 -->

**45.** that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the Lord! <!-- Index: 15651 -->

## Chapter 106

**1.** Praise the Lord! Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever! <!-- Index: 15652 -->

**2.** Who can utter the mighty deeds of the Lord, or declare all his praise? <!-- Index: 15653 -->

**3.** Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times! <!-- Index: 15654 -->

**4.** Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them, <!-- Index: 15655 -->

**5.** that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance. <!-- Index: 15656 -->

**6.** Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness. <!-- Index: 15657 -->

**7.** Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea. <!-- Index: 15658 -->

**8.** Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make known his mighty power. <!-- Index: 15659 -->

**9.** He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert. <!-- Index: 15660 -->

**10.** So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy. <!-- Index: 15661 -->

**11.** And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left. <!-- Index: 15662 -->

**12.** Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. <!-- Index: 15663 -->

**13.** But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel. <!-- Index: 15664 -->

**14.** But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert; <!-- Index: 15665 -->

**15.** he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them. <!-- Index: 15666 -->

**16.** When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord, <!-- Index: 15667 -->

**17.** the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. <!-- Index: 15668 -->

**18.** Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. <!-- Index: 15669 -->

**19.** They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image. <!-- Index: 15670 -->

**20.** They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass. <!-- Index: 15671 -->

**21.** They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt, <!-- Index: 15672 -->

**22.** wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. <!-- Index: 15673 -->

**23.** Therefore he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them. <!-- Index: 15674 -->

**24.** Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise. <!-- Index: 15675 -->

**25.** They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the Lord. <!-- Index: 15676 -->

**26.** Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness, <!-- Index: 15677 -->

**27.** and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands. <!-- Index: 15678 -->

**28.** Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead; <!-- Index: 15679 -->

**29.** they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them. <!-- Index: 15680 -->

**30.** Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed. <!-- Index: 15681 -->

**31.** And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever. <!-- Index: 15682 -->

**32.** They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account, <!-- Index: 15683 -->

**33.** for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips. <!-- Index: 15684 -->

**34.** They did not destroy the peoples, as the Lord commanded them, <!-- Index: 15685 -->
