<h1>Proverbs</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='20_01:001'><strong>1.</strong> The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</p>
<p id='20_01:002'><strong>2.</strong> To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</p>
<p id='20_01:003'><strong>3.</strong> to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</p>
<p id='20_01:004'><strong>4.</strong> to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth —</p>
<p id='20_01:005'><strong>5.</strong> Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,</p>
<p id='20_01:006'><strong>6.</strong> to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.</p>
<p id='20_01:007'><strong>7.</strong> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p id='20_01:008'><strong>8.</strong> Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and forsake not your mother’s teaching,</p>
<p id='20_01:009'><strong>9.</strong> for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.</p>
<p id='20_01:010'><strong>10.</strong> My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</p>
<p id='20_01:011'><strong>11.</strong> If they say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;</p>
<p id='20_01:012'><strong>12.</strong> like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</p>
<p id='20_01:013'><strong>13.</strong> we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</p>
<p id='20_01:014'><strong>14.</strong> throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse —</p>
<p id='20_01:015'><strong>15.</strong> my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,</p>
<p id='20_01:016'><strong>16.</strong> for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p id='20_01:017'><strong>17.</strong> For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,</p>
<p id='20_01:018'><strong>18.</strong> but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.</p>
<p id='20_01:019'><strong>19.</strong> Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.</p>
<p id='20_01:020'><strong>20.</strong> Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;</p>
<p id='20_01:021'><strong>21.</strong> at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</p>
<p id='20_01:022'><strong>22.</strong> How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p id='20_01:023'><strong>23.</strong> If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</p>
<p id='20_01:024'><strong>24.</strong> Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</p>
<p id='20_01:025'><strong>25.</strong> because you have ignored all my counsel would have none of my reproof,</p>
<p id='20_01:026'><strong>26.</strong> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,</p>
<p id='20_01:027'><strong>27.</strong> when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</p>
<p id='20_01:028'><strong>28.</strong> Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</p>
<p id='20_01:029'><strong>29.</strong> Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord,</p>
<p id='20_01:030'><strong>30.</strong> would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,</p>
<p id='20_01:031'><strong>31.</strong> therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.</p>
<p id='20_01:032'><strong>32.</strong> For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;</p>
<p id='20_01:033'><strong>33.</strong> but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<p id='20_02:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</p>
<p id='20_02:002'><strong>2.</strong> making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</p>
<p id='20_02:003'><strong>3.</strong> yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</p>
<p id='20_02:004'><strong>4.</strong> if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</p>
<p id='20_02:005'><strong>5.</strong> then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p id='20_02:006'><strong>6.</strong> For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</p>
<p id='20_02:007'><strong>7.</strong> he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</p>
<p id='20_02:008'><strong>8.</strong> guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</p>
<p id='20_02:009'><strong>9.</strong> Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</p>
<p id='20_02:010'><strong>10.</strong> for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</p>
<p id='20_02:011'><strong>11.</strong> discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</p>
<p id='20_02:012'><strong>12.</strong> delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</p>
<p id='20_02:013'><strong>13.</strong> who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</p>
<p id='20_02:014'><strong>14.</strong> who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</p>
<p id='20_02:015'><strong>15.</strong> men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</p>
<p id='20_02:016'><strong>16.</strong> So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</p>
<p id='20_02:017'><strong>17.</strong> who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</p>
<p id='20_02:018'><strong>18.</strong> for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</p>
<p id='20_02:019'><strong>19.</strong> none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</p>
<p id='20_02:020'><strong>20.</strong> So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p id='20_02:021'><strong>21.</strong> For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</p>
<p id='20_02:022'><strong>22.</strong> but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_3'>Chapter 3</h2>
<p id='20_03:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,</p>
<p id='20_03:002'><strong>2.</strong> for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.</p>
<p id='20_03:003'><strong>3.</strong> Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
<p id='20_03:004'><strong>4.</strong> So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p id='20_03:005'><strong>5.</strong> Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</p>
<p id='20_03:006'><strong>6.</strong> In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</p>
<p id='20_03:007'><strong>7.</strong> Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.</p>
<p id='20_03:008'><strong>8.</strong> It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</p>
<p id='20_03:009'><strong>9.</strong> Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</p>
<p id='20_03:010'><strong>10.</strong> then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</p>
<p id='20_03:011'><strong>11.</strong> My son, do not despise the Lord ’s discipline or be weary of his reproof,</p>
<p id='20_03:012'><strong>12.</strong> for the Lord reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</p>
<p id='20_03:013'><strong>13.</strong> Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,</p>
<p id='20_03:014'><strong>14.</strong> for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.</p>
<p id='20_03:015'><strong>15.</strong> She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</p>
<p id='20_03:016'><strong>16.</strong> Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</p>
<p id='20_03:017'><strong>17.</strong> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</p>
<p id='20_03:018'><strong>18.</strong> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</p>
<p id='20_03:019'><strong>19.</strong> The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</p>
<p id='20_03:020'><strong>20.</strong> by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p id='20_03:021'><strong>21.</strong> My son, do not lose sight of these— keep sound wisdom and discretion,</p>
<p id='20_03:022'><strong>22.</strong> and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</p>
<p id='20_03:023'><strong>23.</strong> Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.</p>
<p id='20_03:024'><strong>24.</strong> If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</p>
<p id='20_03:025'><strong>25.</strong> Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</p>
<p id='20_03:026'><strong>26.</strong> for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.</p>
<p id='20_03:027'><strong>27.</strong> Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.</p>
<p id='20_03:028'><strong>28.</strong> Do not say to your neighbor, Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it —when you have it with you.</p>
<p id='20_03:029'><strong>29.</strong> Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.</p>
<p id='20_03:030'><strong>30.</strong> Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.</p>
<p id='20_03:031'><strong>31.</strong> Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,</p>
<p id='20_03:032'><strong>32.</strong> for the devious person is an abomination to the Lord, but the upright are in his confidence.</p>
<p id='20_03:033'><strong>33.</strong> The Lord ’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</p>
<p id='20_03:034'><strong>34.</strong> Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.</p>
<p id='20_03:035'><strong>35.</strong> The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_4'>Chapter 4</h2>
<p id='20_04:001'><strong>1.</strong> Hear, O sons, a father’s instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight,</p>
<p id='20_04:002'><strong>2.</strong> for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.</p>
<p id='20_04:003'><strong>3.</strong> When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,</p>
<p id='20_04:004'><strong>4.</strong> he taught me and said to me, Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p id='20_04:005'><strong>5.</strong> Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p id='20_04:006'><strong>6.</strong> Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.</p>
<p id='20_04:007'><strong>7.</strong> The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.</p>
<p id='20_04:008'><strong>8.</strong> Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.</p>
<p id='20_04:009'><strong>9.</strong> She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.</p>
<p id='20_04:010'><strong>10.</strong> Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.</p>
<p id='20_04:011'><strong>11.</strong> I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.</p>
<p id='20_04:012'><strong>12.</strong> When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble.</p>
<p id='20_04:013'><strong>13.</strong> Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.</p>
<p id='20_04:014'><strong>14.</strong> Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.</p>
<p id='20_04:015'><strong>15.</strong> Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.</p>
<p id='20_04:016'><strong>16.</strong> For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.</p>
<p id='20_04:017'><strong>17.</strong> For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p id='20_04:018'><strong>18.</strong> But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.</p>
<p id='20_04:019'><strong>19.</strong> The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.</p>
<p id='20_04:020'><strong>20.</strong> My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</p>
<p id='20_04:021'><strong>21.</strong> Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.</p>
<p id='20_04:022'><strong>22.</strong> For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.</p>
<p id='20_04:023'><strong>23.</strong> Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.</p>
<p id='20_04:024'><strong>24.</strong> Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.</p>
<p id='20_04:025'><strong>25.</strong> Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.</p>
<p id='20_04:026'><strong>26.</strong> Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.</p>
<p id='20_04:027'><strong>27.</strong> Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_5'>Chapter 5</h2>
<p id='20_05:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,</p>
<p id='20_05:002'><strong>2.</strong> that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.</p>
<p id='20_05:003'><strong>3.</strong> For the lips of a woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,</p>
<p id='20_05:004'><strong>4.</strong> but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p id='20_05:005'><strong>5.</strong> Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;</p>
<p id='20_05:006'><strong>6.</strong> she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.</p>
<p id='20_05:007'><strong>7.</strong> And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p id='20_05:008'><strong>8.</strong> Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,</p>
<p id='20_05:009'><strong>9.</strong> lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless,</p>
<p id='20_05:010'><strong>10.</strong> lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,</p>
<p id='20_05:011'><strong>11.</strong> and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,</p>
<p id='20_05:012'><strong>12.</strong> and you say, How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!</p>
<p id='20_05:013'><strong>13.</strong> I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.</p>
<p id='20_05:014'><strong>14.</strong> I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation.</p>
<p id='20_05:015'><strong>15.</strong> Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.</p>
<p id='20_05:016'><strong>16.</strong> Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?</p>
<p id='20_05:017'><strong>17.</strong> Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.</p>
<p id='20_05:018'><strong>18.</strong> Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,</p>
<p id='20_05:019'><strong>19.</strong> a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.</p>
<p id='20_05:020'><strong>20.</strong> Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?</p>
<p id='20_05:021'><strong>21.</strong> For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he ponders all his paths.</p>
<p id='20_05:022'><strong>22.</strong> The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.</p>
<p id='20_05:023'><strong>23.</strong> He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_6'>Chapter 6</h2>
<p id='20_06:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, if you have security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger,</p>
<p id='20_06:002'><strong>2.</strong> if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth,</p>
<p id='20_06:003'><strong>3.</strong> then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</p>
<p id='20_06:004'><strong>4.</strong> Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;</p>
<p id='20_06:005'><strong>5.</strong> save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p id='20_06:006'><strong>6.</strong> Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</p>
<p id='20_06:007'><strong>7.</strong> Without having any chief, officer, or ruler,</p>
<p id='20_06:008'><strong>8.</strong> she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.</p>
<p id='20_06:009'><strong>9.</strong> How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?</p>
<p id='20_06:010'><strong>10.</strong> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</p>
<p id='20_06:011'><strong>11.</strong> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</p>
<p id='20_06:012'><strong>12.</strong> A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</p>
<p id='20_06:013'><strong>13.</strong> winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,</p>
<p id='20_06:014'><strong>14.</strong> with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</p>
<p id='20_06:015'><strong>15.</strong> therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</p>
<p id='20_06:016'><strong>16.</strong> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him:</p>
<p id='20_06:017'><strong>17.</strong> haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p id='20_06:018'><strong>18.</strong> a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,</p>
<p id='20_06:019'><strong>19.</strong> a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.</p>
<p id='20_06:020'><strong>20.</strong> My son, keep your father’s commandment, and forsake not your mother’s teaching.</p>
<p id='20_06:021'><strong>21.</strong> Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.</p>
<p id='20_06:022'><strong>22.</strong> When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</p>
<p id='20_06:023'><strong>23.</strong> For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</p>
<p id='20_06:024'><strong>24.</strong> to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</p>
<p id='20_06:025'><strong>25.</strong> Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</p>
<p id='20_06:026'><strong>26.</strong> for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</p>
<p id='20_06:027'><strong>27.</strong> Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p id='20_06:028'><strong>28.</strong> Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?</p>
<p id='20_06:029'><strong>29.</strong> So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.</p>
<p id='20_06:030'><strong>30.</strong> People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</p>
<p id='20_06:031'><strong>31.</strong> but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.</p>
<p id='20_06:032'><strong>32.</strong> He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.</p>
<p id='20_06:033'><strong>33.</strong> He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</p>
<p id='20_06:034'><strong>34.</strong> For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.</p>
<p id='20_06:035'><strong>35.</strong> He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_7'>Chapter 7</h2>
<p id='20_07:001'><strong>1.</strong> My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you;</p>
<p id='20_07:002'><strong>2.</strong> keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;</p>
<p id='20_07:003'><strong>3.</strong> bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
<p id='20_07:004'><strong>4.</strong> Say to wisdom, You are my sister, and call insight your intimate friend,</p>
<p id='20_07:005'><strong>5.</strong> to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.</p>
<p id='20_07:006'><strong>6.</strong> For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice,</p>
<p id='20_07:007'><strong>7.</strong> and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense,</p>
<p id='20_07:008'><strong>8.</strong> passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house</p>
<p id='20_07:009'><strong>9.</strong> in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.</p>
<p id='20_07:010'><strong>10.</strong> And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.</p>
<p id='20_07:011'><strong>11.</strong> She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;</p>
<p id='20_07:012'><strong>12.</strong> now in the street, now in the market, at every corner she lies in wait.</p>

<p id='20_26:023'><strong>23.</strong> Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart.</p>
<p id='20_26:024'><strong>24.</strong> Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart;</p>

<h2 id='chapter_27'>Chapter 27</h2>
<p id='20_27:001'><strong>1.</strong> Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.</p>
<p id='20_27:002'><strong>2.</strong> Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.</p>
<p id='20_27:003'><strong>3.</strong> A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty, but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.</p>

<p id='20_28:003'><strong>3.</strong> A poor man who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food.</p>
<p id='20_28:004'><strong>4.</strong> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law strive against them.</p>
<p id='20_28:005'><strong>5.</strong> Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the Lord understand it completely.</p>
<p id='20_28:006'><strong>6.</strong> Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.</p>
<p id='20_28:007'><strong>7.</strong> The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding, but a companion of gluttons shames his father.</p>

<p id='20_29:008'><strong>8.</strong> Scoffers set a city aflame, but the wise turn away wrath.</p>
<p id='20_29:009'><strong>9.</strong> If a wise man has an argument with a fool, the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet.</p>

<h2 id='chapter_30'>Chapter 30</h2>

<p id='20_30:005'><strong>5.</strong> Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</p>
<p id='20_30:006'><strong>6.</strong> Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.</p>
<p id='20_30:007'><strong>7.</strong> Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die:</p>
<p id='20_30:008'><strong>8.</strong> Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,</p>
<p id='20_30:009'><strong>9.</strong> lest I be full and deny you and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God.</p>
<p id='20_30:010'><strong>10.</strong> Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.</p>
<p id='20_30:011'><strong>11.</strong> There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.</p>
<p id='20_30:012'><strong>12.</strong> There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth.</p>
<p id='20_30:013'><strong>13.</strong> There are those — how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!</p>
<p id='20_30:014'><strong>14.</strong> There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.</p>
<p id='20_30:015'><strong>15.</strong> The leech has two daughters: Give and Give. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, Enough:</p>
<p id='20_30:016'><strong>16.</strong> Sheol, the barren womb, the land never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, Enough.</p>
<p id='20_30:017'><strong>17.</strong> The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.</p>
<p id='20_30:018'><strong>18.</strong> Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:</p>
<p id='20_30:019'><strong>19.</strong> the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a virgin.</p>
<p id='20_30:020'><strong>20.</strong> This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, I have done no wrong.</p>
<p id='20_30:021'><strong>21.</strong> Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:</p>
<p id='20_30:022'><strong>22.</strong> a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food;</p>
<p id='20_30:023'><strong>23.</strong> an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.</p>
<p id='20_30:024'><strong>24.</strong> Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise:</p>
<p id='20_30:025'><strong>25.</strong> the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;</p>
<p id='20_30:026'><strong>26.</strong> the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;</p>
<p id='20_30:027'><strong>27.</strong> the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;</p>
<p id='20_30:028'><strong>28.</strong> the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings ’ palaces.</p>
<p id='20_30:029'><strong>29.</strong> Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride:</p>
<p id='20_30:030'><strong>30.</strong> the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any;</p>
<p id='20_30:031'><strong>31.</strong> the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him.</p>
<p id='20_30:032'><strong>32.</strong> If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.</p>
<p id='20_30:033'><strong>33.</strong> For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_31'>Chapter 31</h2>
<p id='20_31:001'><strong>1.</strong> The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:</p>

<p id='20_31:003'><strong>3.</strong> Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.</p>
<p id='20_31:004'><strong>4.</strong> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink,</p>
<p id='20_31:005'><strong>5.</strong> lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.</p>
<p id='20_31:006'><strong>6.</strong> Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress;</p>
<p id='20_31:007'><strong>7.</strong> let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.</p>
<p id='20_31:008'><strong>8.</strong> Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.</p>
<p id='20_31:009'><strong>9.</strong> Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.</p>
<p id='20_31:010'><strong>10.</strong> An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.</p>
<p id='20_31:011'><strong>11.</strong> The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.</p>
<p id='20_31:012'><strong>12.</strong> She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.</p>
<p id='20_31:013'><strong>13.</strong> She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.</p>
<p id='20_31:014'><strong>14.</strong> She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar.</p>
<p id='20_31:015'><strong>15.</strong> She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens.</p>
<p id='20_31:016'><strong>16.</strong> She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</p>
<p id='20_31:017'><strong>17.</strong> She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong.</p>
<p id='20_31:018'><strong>18.</strong> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.</p>
<p id='20_31:019'><strong>19.</strong> She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</p>
<p id='20_31:020'><strong>20.</strong> She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.</p>
<p id='20_31:021'><strong>21.</strong> She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.</p>
<p id='20_31:022'><strong>22.</strong> She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</p>
<p id='20_31:023'><strong>23.</strong> Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.</p>
<p id='20_31:024'><strong>24.</strong> She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant.</p>
<p id='20_31:025'><strong>25.</strong> Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.</p>
<p id='20_31:026'><strong>26.</strong> She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.</p>
<p id='20_31:027'><strong>27.</strong> She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</p>
<p id='20_31:028'><strong>28.</strong> Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</p>
<p id='20_31:029'><strong>29.</strong> Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all.</p>
<p id='20_31:030'><strong>30.</strong> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.</p>
