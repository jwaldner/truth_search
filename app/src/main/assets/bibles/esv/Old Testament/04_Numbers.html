<p id='04_10:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And over the company of the tribe of the people of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.</p>
<p id='04_10:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things, and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.</p>
<p id='04_10:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> And the standard of the camp of the people of Ephraim set out by their companies, and over their company was Elishama the son of Ammihud.</p>
<p id='04_10:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> And over the company of the tribe of the people of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.</p>
<p id='04_10:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And over the company of the tribe of the people of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.</p>
<p id='04_10:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Then the standard of the camp of the people of Dan, acting as the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their companies, and over their company was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.</p>
<p id='04_10:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> And over the company of the tribe of the people of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.</p>
<p id='04_10:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> And over the company of the tribe of the people of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.</p>
<p id='04_10:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> This was the order of march of the people of Israel by their companies, when they set out.</p>
<p id='04_10:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses ’ father-in-law, We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will do good to you, for the Lord has promised good to Israel.</p>
<p id='04_10:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> But he said to him, I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.</p>
<p id='04_10:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> And he said, Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us.</p>
<p id='04_10:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> And if you do go with us, whatever good the Lord will do to us, the same will we do to you.</p>
<p id='04_10:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> So they set out from the mount of the Lord three days ’ journey. And the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them three days ’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.</p>
<p id='04_10:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> And the cloud of the Lord was over them by day, whenever they set out from the camp.</p>
<p id='04_10:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> And whenever the ark set out, Moses said, Arise, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee before you.</p>
<p id='04_10:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_11'>Chapter 11</h2>
<p id='04_11:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And the people complained in the hearing of the Lord about their misfortunes, and when the Lord heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.</p>
<p id='04_11:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire died down.</p>
<p id='04_11:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the Lord burned among them.</p>
<p id='04_11:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also wept again and said, Oh that we had meat to eat!</p>
<p id='04_11:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.</p>
<p id='04_11:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.</p>
<p id='04_11:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.</p>
<p id='04_11:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.</p>
<p id='04_11:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.</p>
<p id='04_11:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the Lord blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased.</p>
<p id='04_11:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Moses said to the Lord, Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?</p>
<p id='04_11:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child, to the land that you swore to give their fathers?</p>
<p id='04_11:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, Give us meat, that we may eat.</p>
<p id='04_11:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.</p>
<p id='04_11:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.</p>
<p id='04_11:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Then the Lord said to Moses, Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.</p>
<p id='04_11:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.</p>
<p id='04_11:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And say to the people, Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the Lord, saying, Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt. Therefore the Lord will give you meat, and you shall eat.</p>
<p id='04_11:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,</p>
<p id='04_11:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the Lord who is among you and have wept before him, saying, Why did we come out of Egypt?</p>
<p id='04_11:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> But Moses said, The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!</p>
<p id='04_11:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?</p>
<p id='04_11:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> And the Lord said to Moses, Is the Lord ’s hand shortened? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not.</p>
<p id='04_11:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent.</p>
<p id='04_11:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.</p>
<p id='04_11:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.</p>
<p id='04_11:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> And a young man ran and told Moses, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.</p>
<p id='04_11:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> And Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, My lord Moses, stop them.</p>
<p id='04_11:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> But Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord ’s people were prophets, that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!</p>
<p id='04_11:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</p>
<p id='04_11:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> Then a wind from the Lord sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground.</p>
<p id='04_11:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.</p>
<p id='04_11:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord struck down the people with a very great plague.</p>
<p id='04_11:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.</p>
<p id='04_11:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_12'>Chapter 12</h2>
<p id='04_12:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.</p>
<p id='04_12:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And they said, Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also? And the Lord heard it.</p>
<p id='04_12:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.</p>
<p id='04_12:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting. And the three of them came out.</p>
<p id='04_12:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.</p>
<p id='04_12:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And he said, Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream.</p>
<p id='04_12:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.</p>
<p id='04_12:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</p>
<p id='04_12:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he departed.</p>
<p id='04_12:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.</p>
<p id='04_12:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned.</p>
<p id='04_12:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother’s womb.</p>
<p id='04_12:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And Moses cried to the Lord, O God, please heal her—please.</p>
<p id='04_12:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> But the Lord said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.</p>
<p id='04_12:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> So Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.</p>
<p id='04_12:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_13'>Chapter 13</h2>
<p id='04_13:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p id='04_13:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them.</p>
<p id='04_13:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the Lord, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel.</p>
<p id='04_13:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;</p>
<p id='04_13:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;</p>
<p id='04_13:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;</p>
<p id='04_13:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;</p>
<p id='04_13:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;</p>
<p id='04_13:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;</p>
<p id='04_13:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;</p>
<p id='04_13:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi;</p>
<p id='04_13:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;</p>
<p id='04_13:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;</p>
<p id='04_13:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;</p>
<p id='04_13:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p>
<p id='04_13:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</p>
<p id='04_13:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, Go up into the Negeb and go up into the hill country,</p>
<p id='04_13:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,</p>
<p id='04_13:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,</p>
<p id='04_13:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.</p>
<p id='04_13:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath.</p>
<p id='04_13:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> They went up into the Negeb and came to Hebron. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p>
<p id='04_13:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs.</p>
<p id='04_13:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there.</p>
<p id='04_13:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.</p>
<p id='04_13:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</p>
<p id='04_13:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> And they told him, We came to the land to which you sent us. It flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.</p>
<p id='04_13:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.</p>
<p id='04_13:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.</p>
<p id='04_13:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it.</p>
<p id='04_13:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> Then the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are.</p>
<p id='04_13:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> So they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people that we saw in it are of great height.</p>
<p id='04_13:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_14'>Chapter 14</h2>
<p id='04_14:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.</p>
<p id='04_14:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And all the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!</p>
<p id='04_14:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> Why is the Lord bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?</p>
<p id='04_14:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And they said to one another, Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt.</p>
<p id='04_14:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel.</p>
<p id='04_14:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes</p>
<p id='04_14:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> and said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.</p>
<p id='04_14:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> If the Lord delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.</p>
<p id='04_14:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection is removed from them, and the Lord is with us; do not fear them.</p>
<p id='04_14:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Then all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.</p>
<p id='04_14:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And the Lord said to Moses, How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?</p>
<p id='04_14:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.</p>
<p id='04_14:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> But Moses said to the Lord, Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for you brought up this people in your might from among them,</p>
<p id='04_14:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O Lord, are in the midst of this people. For you, O Lord, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.</p>
<p id='04_14:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Now if you kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will say,</p>
<p id='04_14:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> It is because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to give to them that he has killed them in the wilderness.</p>
<p id='04_14:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And now, please let the power of the Lord be great as you have promised, saying,</p>
<p id='04_14:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> The Lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, to the third and the fourth generation.</p>
<p id='04_14:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> Please pardon the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt until now.</p>
<p id='04_14:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Then the Lord said, I have pardoned, according to your word.</p>
<p id='04_14:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> But truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord,</p>
<p id='04_14:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the test these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,</p>
<p id='04_14:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> shall see the land that I swore to give to their fathers. And none of those who despised me shall see it.</p>
<p id='04_14:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.</p>
<p id='04_14:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</p>
<p id='04_14:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> And the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p>
<p id='04_14:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> How long shall this wicked congregation grumble against me? I have heard the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against me.</p>
<p id='04_14:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord, what you have said in my hearing I will do to you:</p>
<p id='04_14:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, and of all your number, listed in the census from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against me,</p>
<p id='04_14:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> not one shall come into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
<p id='04_14:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> But your little ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land that you have rejected.</p>

<h2 id='chapter_16'>Chapter 16</h2>
<p id='04_16:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Now Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men.</p>

For all in the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord?</p>
<p id='04_16:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> When Moses heard it, he fell on his face,</p>
<p id='04_16:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> and he said to Korah and all his company, In the morning the Lord will show who is his, and who is holy, and will bring him near to him. The one whom he chooses he will bring near to him.</p>

<p id='04_16:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:</p>
<p id='04_16:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do service in the tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister to them,</p>
<p id='04_16:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> and that he has brought you near him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And would you seek the priesthood also?</p>
<p id='04_16:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Therefore it is against the Lord that you and all your company have gathered together. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?</p>
<p id='04_16:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and they said, We will not come up.</p>
<p id='04_16:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also make yourself a prince over us?</p>
<p id='04_16:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.</p>
<p id='04_16:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> And Moses was very angry and said to the Lord, Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed one of them.</p>
<p id='04_16:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And Moses said to Korah, Be present, you and all your company, before the Lord, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.</p>
<p id='04_16:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> And let every one of you take his censer and put incense on it, and every one of you bring before the Lord his censer, 250 censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.</p>
<p id='04_16:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> So every man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p id='04_16:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.</p>
<p id='04_16:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p>

<p id='04_16:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> And they fell on their faces and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?</p>
<p id='04_16:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p id='04_16:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Say to the congregation, Get away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</p>
<p id='04_16:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</p>
<p id='04_16:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be swept away with all their sins.</p>
<p id='04_16:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> So they got away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.</p>
<p id='04_16:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> And Moses said, Hereby you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own accord.</p>
<p id='04_16:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> If these men die as all men die, or if they are visited by the fate of all mankind, then the Lord has not sent me.</p>
<p id='04_16:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> But if the Lord creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the Lord.</p>

<p id='04_16:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the people who belonged to Korah and all their goods.</p>
<p id='04_16:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.</p>
<p id='04_16:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> And all Israel who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up!</p>
<p id='04_16:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> And fire came out from the Lord and consumed the 250 men offering the incense.</p>
<p id='04_16:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p id='04_16:037' data-selected='false'><strong>37.</strong> Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers out of the blaze. Then scatter the fire far and wide, for they have become holy.</p>
<p id='04_16:038' data-selected='false'><strong>38.</strong> As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they offered them before the Lord, and they became holy. Thus they shall be a sign to the people of Israel.</p>
<p id='04_16:039' data-selected='false'><strong>39.</strong> So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar,</p>
<p id='04_16:040' data-selected='false'><strong>40.</strong> to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should draw near to burn incense before the Lord, lest he become like Korah and his company —as the Lord said to him through Moses.</p>
<p id='04_16:041' data-selected='false'><strong>41.</strong> But on the next day all the congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of the Lord.</p>
<p id='04_16:042' data-selected='false'><strong>42.</strong> And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting. And behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.</p>
<p id='04_16:043' data-selected='false'><strong>43.</strong> And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,</p>
<p id='04_16:044' data-selected='false'><strong>44.</strong> and the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p id='04_16:045' data-selected='false'><strong>45.</strong> Get away from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.</p>
<p id='04_16:046' data-selected='false'><strong>46.</strong> And Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire on it from off the altar and lay incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone out from the Lord; the plague has begun.</p>
<p id='04_16:047' data-selected='false'><strong>47.</strong> So Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had already begun among the people. And he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.</p>
<p id='04_16:048' data-selected='false'><strong>48.</strong> And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.</p>
<p id='04_16:049' data-selected='false'><strong>49.</strong> Now those who died in the plague were 14,700, besides those who died in the affair of Korah.</p>

<p id='04_17:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the staff of the man whom I choose shall sprout. Thus I will make to cease from me the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against you.</p>
<p id='04_17:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Moses spoke to the people of Israel. And all their chiefs gave him staffs, one for each chief, according to their fathers ’ houses, twelve staffs. And the staff of Aaron was among their staffs.</p>

<p id='04_17:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds.</p>
<p id='04_17:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the Lord to all the people of Israel. And they looked, and each man took his staff.</p>
<p id='04_17:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the Lord said to Moses, Put back the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebels, that you may make an end of their grumblings against me, lest they die.</p>

<p id='04_20:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh. And Miriam died there and was buried there.</p>

<p id='04_20:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.</p>

<p id='04_20:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.</p>

<p id='04_21:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And the Lord heeded the voice of Israel and gave over the Canaanites, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah.</p>
<p id='04_21:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way.</p>
<p id='04_21:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.</p>
<p id='04_21:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.</p>
<p id='04_21:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you. Pray to the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. So Moses prayed for the people.</p>
<p id='04_21:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> And the Lord said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.</p>
<p id='04_21:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.</p>
<p id='04_21:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the people of Israel set out and camped in Oboth.</p>
<p id='04_21:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise.</p>

<p id='04_21:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p>
<p id='04_21:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord, Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,</p>

<p id='04_21:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> And from there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the Lord said to Moses, Gather the people together, so that I may give them water.</p>
<p id='04_21:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well!— Sing to it!—</p>
<p id='04_21:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> the well that the princes made, that the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter and with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah,</p>

<p id='04_21:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that looks down on the desert.</p>
<p id='04_21:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</p>

<p id='04_21:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.</p>
<p id='04_21:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong.</p>
<p id='04_21:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.</p>
<p id='04_21:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.</p>
<p id='04_21:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> Therefore the ballad singers say, Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established.</p>
<p id='04_21:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> For fire came out from Heshbon, flame from the city of Sihon. It devoured Ar of Moab, and swallowed the heights of the Arnon.</p>
<p id='04_21:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> Woe to you, O Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters captives, to an Amorite king, Sihon.</p>

<p id='04_21:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.</p>
<p id='04_21:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.</p>
<p id='04_21:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>
<p id='04_21:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> But the Lord said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people, and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.</p>
<p id='04_21:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> So they defeated him and his sons and all his people, until he had no survivor left. And they possessed his land.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_22'>Chapter 22</h2>
<p id='04_22:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> Then the people of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.</p>
<p id='04_22:002' data-selected='false'><strong>2.</strong> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p>

<p id='04_22:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> And Moab said to the elders of Midian, This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,</p>
<p id='04_22:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the people of Amaw, to call him, saying, Behold, a people has come out of Egypt.

<p id='04_22:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.</p>

<p id='04_22:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.</p>
<p id='04_22:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, Go to your own land, for the Lord has refused to let me go with you.</p>
<p id='04_22:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.</p>
<p id='04_22:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Once again Balak sent princes, more in number and more honorable than these.</p>

<p id='04_22:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the Lord my God to do less or more.</p>
<p id='04_22:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> So you, too, please stay here tonight, that I may know what more the Lord will say to me.</p>
<p id='04_22:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only do what I tell you.</p>
<p id='04_22:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.</p>
<p id='04_22:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> But God’s anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the Lord took his stand in the way as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him.</p>
<p id='04_22:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> And the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand. And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the road.</p>
<p id='04_22:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side.</p>
<p id='04_22:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And when the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So he struck her again.</p>
<p id='04_22:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> Then the angel of the Lord went ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.</p>
<p id='04_22:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</p>
<p id='04_22:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> Then the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?</p>
<p id='04_22:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.</p>
<p id='04_22:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way? And he said, No.</p>
<p id='04_22:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face.</p>
<p id='04_22:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> And the angel of the Lord said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me.</p>
<p id='04_22:033' data-selected='false'><strong>33.</strong> The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live.</p>
<p id='04_22:034' data-selected='false'><strong>34.</strong> Then Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.</p>
<p id='04_22:035' data-selected='false'><strong>35.</strong> And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you. So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.</p>
<p id='04_22:036' data-selected='false'><strong>36.</strong> When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the border formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the border.</p>
<p id='04_22:037' data-selected='false'><strong>37.</strong> And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?</p>
<p id='04_22:038' data-selected='false'><strong>38.</strong> Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you! Have I now any power of my own to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak.</p>
<p id='04_22:039' data-selected='false'><strong>39.</strong> Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.</p>
<p id='04_22:040' data-selected='false'><strong>40.</strong> And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him.</p>
<p id='04_22:041' data-selected='false'><strong>41.</strong> And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw a fraction of the people.</p>

<p id='04_23:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.</p>

<p id='04_23:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> And Balaam said to Balak, Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to a bare height,</p>
<p id='04_23:004' data-selected='false'><strong>4.</strong> and God met Balaam. And Balaam said to him, I have arranged the seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.</p>
<p id='04_23:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And the Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.</p>
<p id='04_23:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> And he returned to him, and behold, he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering.</p>
<p id='04_23:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> And Balaam took up his discourse and said, From Aram Balak has brought me, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains: Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, denounce Israel!</p>

<p id='04_23:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!</p>

<p id='04_23:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And he answered and said, Must I not take care to speak what the Lord puts in my mouth?</p>
<p id='04_23:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place, from which you may see them. You shall see only a fraction of them and shall not see them all. Then curse them for me from there.</p>
<p id='04_23:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</p>
<p id='04_23:015' data-selected='false'><strong>15.</strong> Balaam said to Balak, Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet the Lord over there.</p>

<p id='04_23:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> And Balaam took up his discourse and said, Rise, Balak, and hear; give ear to me, O son of Zippor:</p>
<p id='04_23:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?</p>
<p id='04_23:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Behold, I received a command to bless: he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.</p>
<p id='04_23:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob, nor has he seen trouble in Israel. The Lord their God is with them, and the shout of a king is among them.</p>
<p id='04_23:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> God brings them out of Egypt and is for them like the horns of the wild ox.</p>
<p id='04_23:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> For there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, What has God wrought!</p>

<p id='04_24:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> and he took up his discourse and said, The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,</p>

<p id='04_24:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> He crouched, he lay down like a lion and like a lioness; who will rouse him up? Blessed are those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you.</p>
<p id='04_24:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times.</p>
<p id='04_24:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Therefore now flee to your own place. I said, I will certainly honor you, but the Lord has held you back from honor.</p>
<p id='04_24:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,</p>

<p id='04_24:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, I will let you know what this people will do to your people in the latter days.</p>

<p id='04_24:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> Then he looked on Amalek and took up his discourse and said, Amalek was the first among the nations, but its end is utter destruction.</p>
<p id='04_24:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, Enduring is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock.</p>

<h2 id='chapter_25'>Chapter 25</h2>
<p id='04_25:001' data-selected='false'><strong>1.</strong> While Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab.</p>

<p id='04_25:003' data-selected='false'><strong>3.</strong> So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.</p>

<p id='04_31:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> and took all the spoil and all the plunder, both of man and of beast.</p>
<p id='04_31:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.</p>
<p id='04_31:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.</p>

<p id='04_32:005' data-selected='false'><strong>5.</strong> And they said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not take us across the Jordan.</p>
<p id='04_32:006' data-selected='false'><strong>6.</strong> But Moses said to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war while you sit here?</p>
<p id='04_32:007' data-selected='false'><strong>7.</strong> Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going over into the land that the Lord has given them?</p>
<p id='04_32:008' data-selected='false'><strong>8.</strong> Your fathers did this, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</p>
<p id='04_32:009' data-selected='false'><strong>9.</strong> For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the land that the Lord had given them.</p>
<p id='04_32:010' data-selected='false'><strong>10.</strong> And the Lord ’s anger was kindled on that day, and he swore, saying,</p>
<p id='04_32:011' data-selected='false'><strong>11.</strong> Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me,</p>
<p id='04_32:012' data-selected='false'><strong>12.</strong> none except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the Lord.</p>
<p id='04_32:013' data-selected='false'><strong>13.</strong> And the Lord ’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was gone.</p>
<p id='04_32:014' data-selected='false'><strong>14.</strong> And behold, you have risen in your fathers ’ place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the Lord against Israel!</p>

<p id='04_32:016' data-selected='false'><strong>16.</strong> Then they came near to him and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,</p>
<p id='04_32:017' data-selected='false'><strong>17.</strong> but we will take up arms, ready to go before the people of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p id='04_32:018' data-selected='false'><strong>18.</strong> We will not return to our homes until each of the people of Israel has gained his inheritance.</p>
<p id='04_32:019' data-selected='false'><strong>19.</strong> For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east.</p>
<p id='04_32:020' data-selected='false'><strong>20.</strong> So Moses said to them, If you will do this, if you will take up arms to go before the Lord for the war,</p>
<p id='04_32:021' data-selected='false'><strong>21.</strong> and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the Lord, until he has driven out his enemies from before him</p>
<p id='04_32:022' data-selected='false'><strong>22.</strong> and the land is subdued before the Lord; then after that you shall return and be free of obligation to the Lord and to Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the Lord.</p>
<p id='04_32:023' data-selected='false'><strong>23.</strong> But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the Lord, and be sure your sin will find you out.</p>
<p id='04_32:024' data-selected='false'><strong>24.</strong> Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what you have promised.</p>
<p id='04_32:025' data-selected='false'><strong>25.</strong> And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben said to Moses, Your servants will do as my lord commands.</p>
<p id='04_32:026' data-selected='false'><strong>26.</strong> Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead,</p>
<p id='04_32:027' data-selected='false'><strong>27.</strong> but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord orders.</p>
<p id='04_32:028' data-selected='false'><strong>28.</strong> So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers ’ houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.</p>
<p id='04_32:029' data-selected='false'><strong>29.</strong> And Moses said to them, If the people of Gad and the people of Reuben, every man who is armed to battle before the Lord, will pass with you over the Jordan and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.</p>
<p id='04_32:030' data-selected='false'><strong>30.</strong> However, if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p id='04_32:031' data-selected='false'><strong>31.</strong> And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben answered, What the Lord has said to your servants, we will do.</p>
<p id='04_32:032' data-selected='false'><strong>32.</strong> We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.</p>
