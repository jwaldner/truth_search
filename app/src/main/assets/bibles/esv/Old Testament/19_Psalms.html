<h1>Psalms</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='19_01:001'><strong>1.</strong> Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;</p>
<p id='19_01:002'><strong>2.</strong> but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.</p>
<p id='19_01:003'><strong>3.</strong> He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.</p>
<p id='19_01:004'><strong>4.</strong> The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.</p>
<p id='19_01:005'><strong>5.</strong> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;</p>
<p id='19_01:006'><strong>6.</strong> for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<p id='19_02:001'><strong>1.</strong> Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?</p>
<p id='19_02:002'><strong>2.</strong> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,</p>
<p id='19_02:003'><strong>3.</strong> Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.</p>
<p id='19_02:004'><strong>4.</strong> He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.</p>
<p id='19_02:005'><strong>5.</strong> Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,</p>
<p id='19_02:006'><strong>6.</strong> As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.</p>
<p id='19_02:007'><strong>7.</strong> I will tell of the decree: The Lord said to me, You are my Son; today I have begotten you.</p>
<p id='19_02:008'><strong>8.</strong> Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.</p>
<p id='19_02:009'><strong>9.</strong> You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.</p>
<p id='19_02:010'><strong>10.</strong> Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.</p>
<p id='19_02:011'><strong>11.</strong> Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p id='19_02:012'><strong>12.</strong> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_3'>Chapter 3</h2>
<p id='19_03:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. O Lord, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;</p>
<p id='19_03:002'><strong>2.</strong> many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God. Selah</p>
<p id='19_03:003'><strong>3.</strong> But you, O Lord, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.</p>
<p id='19_03:004'><strong>4.</strong> I cried aloud to the Lord, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah</p>
<p id='19_03:005'><strong>5.</strong> I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the Lord sustained me.</p>
<p id='19_03:006'><strong>6.</strong> I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.</p>
<p id='19_03:007'><strong>7.</strong> Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.</p>
<p id='19_03:008'><strong>8.</strong> Salvation belongs to the Lord; your blessing be on your people! Selah</p>
<h2 id='chapter_4'>Chapter 4</h2>
<p id='19_04:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!</p>
<p id='19_04:002'><strong>2.</strong> O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah</p>
<p id='19_04:003'><strong>3.</strong> But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.</p>
<p id='19_04:004'><strong>4.</strong> Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah</p>
<p id='19_04:005'><strong>5.</strong> Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_04:006'><strong>6.</strong> There are many who say, Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!</p>
<p id='19_04:007'><strong>7.</strong> You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound.</p>
<p id='19_04:008'><strong>8.</strong> In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_5'>Chapter 5</h2>
<p id='19_05:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: for the flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Lord; consider my groaning.</p>
<p id='19_05:002'><strong>2.</strong> Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray.</p>
<p id='19_05:003'><strong>3.</strong> O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.</p>
<p id='19_05:004'><strong>4.</strong> For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you.</p>
<p id='19_05:005'><strong>5.</strong> The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.</p>
<p id='19_05:006'><strong>6.</strong> You destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</p>
<p id='19_05:007'><strong>7.</strong> But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in the fear of you.</p>
<p id='19_05:008'><strong>8.</strong> Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.</p>
<p id='19_05:009'><strong>9.</strong> For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p id='19_05:010'><strong>10.</strong> Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.</p>
<p id='19_05:011'><strong>11.</strong> But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you.</p>
<p id='19_05:012'><strong>12.</strong> For you bless the righteous, O Lord; you cover him with favor as with a shield.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_6'>Chapter 6</h2>
<p id='19_06:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments; according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.</p>
<p id='19_06:002'><strong>2.</strong> Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing; heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.</p>
<p id='19_06:003'><strong>3.</strong> My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O Lord — how long?</p>
<p id='19_06:004'><strong>4.</strong> Turn, O Lord, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love.</p>
<p id='19_06:005'><strong>5.</strong> For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise?</p>
<p id='19_06:006'><strong>6.</strong> I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.</p>
<p id='19_06:007'><strong>7.</strong> My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes.</p>
<p id='19_06:008'><strong>8.</strong> Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.</p>
<p id='19_06:009'><strong>9.</strong> The Lord has heard my plea; the Lord accepts my prayer.</p>
<p id='19_06:010'><strong>10.</strong> All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_7'>Chapter 7</h2>
<p id='19_07:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning the words of Cush, a Benjaminite. O Lord my God, in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,</p>
<p id='19_07:002'><strong>2.</strong> lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.</p>
<p id='19_07:003'><strong>3.</strong> O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,</p>
<p id='19_07:004'><strong>4.</strong> if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause,</p>
<p id='19_07:005'><strong>5.</strong> let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah</p>
<p id='19_07:006'><strong>6.</strong> Arise, O Lord, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.</p>
<p id='19_07:007'><strong>7.</strong> Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high.</p>
<p id='19_07:008'><strong>8.</strong> The Lord judges the peoples; judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.</p>
<p id='19_07:009'><strong>9.</strong> Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous — you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God!</p>
<p id='19_07:010'><strong>10.</strong> My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.</p>
<p id='19_07:011'><strong>11.</strong> God is a righteous judge, and a God who indignation every day.</p>
<p id='19_07:012'><strong>12.</strong> If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow;</p>
<p id='19_07:013'><strong>13.</strong> he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.</p>
<p id='19_07:014'><strong>14.</strong> Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.</p>
<p id='19_07:015'><strong>15.</strong> He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made.</p>
<p id='19_07:016'><strong>16.</strong> His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends.</p>
<p id='19_07:017'><strong>17.</strong> I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord, the Most High.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_8'>Chapter 8</h2>
<p id='19_08:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of David. O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.</p>
<p id='19_08:002'><strong>2.</strong> Out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p id='19_08:003'><strong>3.</strong> When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,</p>
<p id='19_08:004'><strong>4.</strong> what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?</p>
<p id='19_08:005'><strong>5.</strong> Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.</p>
<p id='19_08:006'><strong>6.</strong> You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet,</p>
<p id='19_08:007'><strong>7.</strong> all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field,</p>
<p id='19_08:008'><strong>8.</strong> the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas.</p>
<p id='19_08:009'><strong>9.</strong> O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!</p>
<h2 id='chapter_9'>Chapter 9</h2>
<p id='19_09:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: according to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.</p>
<p id='19_09:002'><strong>2.</strong> I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</p>
<p id='19_09:003'><strong>3.</strong> When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish your presence.</p>
<p id='19_09:004'><strong>4.</strong> For you have maintained my just cause; you have sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment.</p>
<p id='19_09:005'><strong>5.</strong> You have rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish; you have blotted out their name forever and ever.</p>
<p id='19_09:006'><strong>6.</strong> The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; their cities you rooted out; the very memory of them has perished.</p>
<p id='19_09:007'><strong>7.</strong> But the Lord sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for justice,</p>
<p id='19_09:008'><strong>8.</strong> and he judges the world with righteousness; he judges the peoples with uprightness.</p>
<p id='19_09:009'><strong>9.</strong> The Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.</p>
<p id='19_09:010'><strong>10.</strong> And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.</p>
<p id='19_09:011'><strong>11.</strong> Sing praises to the Lord, who sits enthroned in Zion! Tell among the peoples his deeds!</p>
<p id='19_09:012'><strong>12.</strong> For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p id='19_09:013'><strong>13.</strong> Be gracious to me, O Lord! See my affliction from those who hate me, O you who lift me up from the gates of death,</p>
<p id='19_09:014'><strong>14.</strong> that I may recount all your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in your salvation.</p>
<p id='19_09:015'><strong>15.</strong> The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught.</p>
<p id='19_09:016'><strong>16.</strong> The Lord has made himself known; he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Selah</p>
<p id='19_09:017'><strong>17.</strong> The wicked shall return to Sheol, all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p id='19_09:018'><strong>18.</strong> For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.</p>
<p id='19_09:019'><strong>19.</strong> Arise, O Lord! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before you!</p>
<p id='19_09:020'><strong>20.</strong> Put them in fear, O Lord! Let the nations know that they are but men! Selah</p>
<h2 id='chapter_10'>Chapter 10</h2>
<p id='19_10:001'><strong>1.</strong> Why, O Lord, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</p>
<p id='19_10:002'><strong>2.</strong> In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes that they have devised.</p>
<p id='19_10:003'><strong>3.</strong> For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul, and the one greedy for curses and renounces the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_10:004'><strong>4.</strong> In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, There is no God.</p>
<p id='19_10:005'><strong>5.</strong> His ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at them.</p>
<p id='19_10:006'><strong>6.</strong> He says in his heart, I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity.</p>
<p id='19_10:007'><strong>7.</strong> His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.</p>
<p id='19_10:008'><strong>8.</strong> He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;</p>
<p id='19_10:009'><strong>9.</strong> he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket; he lurks that he may seize the poor; he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.</p>
<p id='19_10:010'><strong>10.</strong> The helpless are crushed, sink down, and fall by his might.</p>
<p id='19_10:011'><strong>11.</strong> He says in his heart, God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it.</p>
<p id='19_10:012'><strong>12.</strong> Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up your hand; forget not the afflicted.</p>
<p id='19_10:013'><strong>13.</strong> Why does the wicked renounce God and say in his heart, You will not call to account?</p>
<p id='19_10:014'><strong>14.</strong> But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation, that you may take it into your hands; to you the helpless commits himself; you have been the helper of the fatherless.</p>
<p id='19_10:015'><strong>15.</strong> Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness to account till you find none.</p>
<p id='19_10:016'><strong>16.</strong> The Lord is king forever and ever; the nations perish from his land.</p>
<p id='19_10:017'><strong>17.</strong> O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear</p>
<p id='19_10:018'><strong>18.</strong> to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_11'>Chapter 11</h2>
<p id='19_11:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster. Of David. In the Lord I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, Flee like a bird to your mountain,</p>
<p id='19_11:002'><strong>2.</strong> for behold, the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;</p>
<p id='19_11:003'><strong>3.</strong> if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>
<p id='19_11:004'><strong>4.</strong> The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord ’s throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man.</p>
<p id='19_11:005'><strong>5.</strong> The Lord tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.</p>
<p id='19_11:006'><strong>6.</strong> Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</p>
<p id='19_11:007'><strong>7.</strong> For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_12'>Chapter 12</h2>
<p id='19_12:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Save, O Lord, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.</p>
<p id='19_12:002'><strong>2.</strong> Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.</p>
<p id='19_12:003'><strong>3.</strong> May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,</p>
<p id='19_12:004'><strong>4.</strong> those who say, With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?</p>
<p id='19_12:005'><strong>5.</strong> Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise, says the Lord; I will place him in the safety for which he longs.</p>
<p id='19_12:006'><strong>6.</strong> The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.</p>
<p id='19_12:007'><strong>7.</strong> You, O Lord, will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever.</p>
<p id='19_12:008'><strong>8.</strong> On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_13'>Chapter 13</h2>
<p id='19_13:001'><strong>1.</strong> How Long, O Lord? To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?</p>
<p id='19_13:002'><strong>2.</strong> How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?</p>
<p id='19_13:003'><strong>3.</strong> Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,</p>
<p id='19_13:004'><strong>4.</strong> lest my enemy say, I have prevailed over him, lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.</p>
<p id='19_13:005'><strong>5.</strong> But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.</p>
<p id='19_13:006'><strong>6.</strong> I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_14'>Chapter 14</h2>
<p id='19_14:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster. Of David. The fool says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good.</p>
<p id='19_14:002'><strong>2.</strong> The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.</p>
<p id='19_14:003'><strong>3.</strong> They have all turned aside; together they have corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.</p>
<p id='19_14:004'><strong>4.</strong> Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the Lord?</p>
<p id='19_14:005'><strong>5.</strong> There they are in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous.</p>
<p id='19_14:006'><strong>6.</strong> You would shame the plans of the poor, but the Lord is his refuge.</p>
<p id='19_14:007'><strong>7.</strong> Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_15'>Chapter 15</h2>
<p id='19_15:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Psalm of David. O Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill?</p>
<p id='19_15:002'><strong>2.</strong> He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart;</p>
<p id='19_15:003'><strong>3.</strong> who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend;</p>
<p id='19_15:004'><strong>4.</strong> in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord; who swears to his own hurt and does not change;</p>
<p id='19_15:005'><strong>5.</strong> who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_16'>Chapter 16</h2>
<p id='19_16:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Miktam of David. Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.</p>
<p id='19_16:002'><strong>2.</strong> I say to the Lord, You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you.</p>
<p id='19_16:003'><strong>3.</strong> As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.</p>
<p id='19_16:004'><strong>4.</strong> The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips.</p>
<p id='19_16:005'><strong>5.</strong> The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.</p>
<p id='19_16:006'><strong>6.</strong> The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.</p>
<p id='19_16:007'><strong>7.</strong> I bless the Lord who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.</p>
<p id='19_16:008'><strong>8.</strong> I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.</p>
<p id='19_16:009'><strong>9.</strong> Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.</p>
<p id='19_16:010'><strong>10.</strong> For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption.</p>
<p id='19_16:011'><strong>11.</strong> You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_17'>Chapter 17</h2>

<p id='19_17:002'><strong>2.</strong> From your presence let my vindication come! Let your eyes behold the right!</p>
<p id='19_17:003'><strong>3.</strong> You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night, you have tested me, and you will find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.</p>
<p id='19_17:004'><strong>4.</strong> With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.</p>
<p id='19_17:005'><strong>5.</strong> My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.</p>

<h2 id='chapter_18'>Chapter 18</h2>
<p id='19_18:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who addressed the words of this song to the Lord on the day when the Lord rescued him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said: I love you, O Lord, my strength.</p>
<p id='19_18:002'><strong>2.</strong> The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</p>
<p id='19_18:003'><strong>3.</strong> I call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.</p>
<p id='19_18:004'><strong>4.</strong> The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction assailed me;</p>
<p id='19_18:005'><strong>5.</strong> the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.</p>
<p id='19_18:006'><strong>6.</strong> In my distress I called upon the Lord; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.</p>
<p id='19_18:007'><strong>7.</strong> Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.</p>
<p id='19_18:008'><strong>8.</strong> Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.</p>
<p id='19_18:009'><strong>9.</strong> He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.</p>
<p id='19_18:010'><strong>10.</strong> He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind.</p>
<p id='19_18:011'><strong>11.</strong> He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water.</p>
<p id='19_18:012'><strong>12.</strong> Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds.</p>
<p id='19_18:013'><strong>13.</strong> The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</p>
<p id='19_18:014'><strong>14.</strong> And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them.</p>
<p id='19_18:015'><strong>15.</strong> Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</p>
<p id='19_18:016'><strong>16.</strong> He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.</p>
<p id='19_18:017'><strong>17.</strong> He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for too mighty for me.</p>
<p id='19_18:018'><strong>18.</strong> They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my support.</p>
<p id='19_18:019'><strong>19.</strong> He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p id='19_18:020'><strong>20.</strong> The Lord dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.</p>
<p id='19_18:021'><strong>21.</strong> For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p id='19_18:022'><strong>22.</strong> For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.</p>
<p id='19_18:023'><strong>23.</strong> I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt.</p>
<p id='19_18:024'><strong>24.</strong> So the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</p>
<p id='19_18:025'><strong>25.</strong> With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;</p>
<p id='19_18:026'><strong>26.</strong> with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.</p>
<p id='19_18:027'><strong>27.</strong> For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.</p>
<p id='19_18:028'><strong>28.</strong> For it is you who light my lamp; the Lord my God lightens my darkness.</p>
<p id='19_18:029'><strong>29.</strong> For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.</p>
<p id='19_18:030'><strong>30.</strong> This God —his way is perfect; the word of the Lord proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.</p>
<p id='19_18:031'><strong>31.</strong> For who is God, but the Lord? And who is a rock, except our God?—</p>
<p id='19_18:032'><strong>32.</strong> the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.</p>
<p id='19_18:033'><strong>33.</strong> He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.</p>
<p id='19_18:034'><strong>34.</strong> He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</p>
<p id='19_18:035'><strong>35.</strong> You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great.</p>
<p id='19_18:036'><strong>36.</strong> You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.</p>
<p id='19_18:037'><strong>37.</strong> I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed.</p>
<p id='19_18:038'><strong>38.</strong> I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.</p>
<p id='19_18:039'><strong>39.</strong> For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.</p>
<p id='19_18:040'><strong>40.</strong> You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.</p>
<p id='19_18:041'><strong>41.</strong> They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the Lord, but he did not answer them.</p>
<p id='19_18:042'><strong>42.</strong> I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</p>
<p id='19_18:043'><strong>43.</strong> You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.</p>
<p id='19_18:044'><strong>44.</strong> As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.</p>
<p id='19_18:045'><strong>45.</strong> Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.</p>
<p id='19_18:046'><strong>46.</strong> The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation —</p>
<p id='19_18:047'><strong>47.</strong> the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,</p>
<p id='19_18:048'><strong>48.</strong> who delivered me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you rescued me from the man of violence.</p>
<p id='19_18:049'><strong>49.</strong> For this I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations, and sing to your name.</p>
<p id='19_18:050'><strong>50.</strong> Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever.</p>

<p id='19_19:011'><strong>11.</strong> Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</p>
<p id='19_19:012'><strong>12.</strong> Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults.</p>

<p id='19_47:002'><strong>2.</strong> For the Lord, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth.</p>
<p id='19_47:003'><strong>3.</strong> He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.</p>
<p id='19_47:004'><strong>4.</strong> He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah</p>
<p id='19_47:005'><strong>5.</strong> God has gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.</p>
<p id='19_47:006'><strong>6.</strong> Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!</p>
<p id='19_47:007'><strong>7.</strong> For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm!</p>
<p id='19_47:008'><strong>8.</strong> God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne.</p>
<p id='19_47:009'><strong>9.</strong> The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted!</p>
<h2 id='chapter_48'>Chapter 48</h2>
<p id='19_48:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain,</p>
<p id='19_48:002'><strong>2.</strong> beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.</p>
<p id='19_48:003'><strong>3.</strong> Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress.</p>
<p id='19_48:004'><strong>4.</strong> For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together.</p>
<p id='19_48:005'><strong>5.</strong> As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight.</p>
<p id='19_48:006'><strong>6.</strong> Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor.</p>
<p id='19_48:007'><strong>7.</strong> By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish.</p>
<p id='19_48:008'><strong>8.</strong> As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah</p>
<p id='19_48:009'><strong>9.</strong> We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.</p>
<p id='19_48:010'><strong>10.</strong> As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness.</p>
<p id='19_48:011'><strong>11.</strong> Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments!</p>
<p id='19_48:012'><strong>12.</strong> Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers,</p>
<p id='19_48:013'><strong>13.</strong> consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation</p>
<p id='19_48:014'><strong>14.</strong> that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_49'>Chapter 49</h2>
<p id='19_49:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,</p>
<p id='19_49:002'><strong>2.</strong> both low and high, rich and poor together!</p>
<p id='19_49:003'><strong>3.</strong> My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.</p>
<p id='19_49:004'><strong>4.</strong> I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.</p>
<p id='19_49:005'><strong>5.</strong> Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me,</p>
<p id='19_49:006'><strong>6.</strong> those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?</p>
<p id='19_49:007'><strong>7.</strong> Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life,</p>
<p id='19_49:008'><strong>8.</strong> for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice,</p>
<p id='19_49:009'><strong>9.</strong> that he should live on forever and never see the pit.</p>
<p id='19_49:010'><strong>10.</strong> For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.</p>
<p id='19_49:011'><strong>11.</strong> Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names.</p>
<p id='19_49:012'><strong>12.</strong> Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish.</p>
<p id='19_49:013'><strong>13.</strong> This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah</p>
<p id='19_49:014'><strong>14.</strong> Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell.</p>
<p id='19_49:015'><strong>15.</strong> But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah</p>
<p id='19_49:016'><strong>16.</strong> Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.</p>
<p id='19_49:017'><strong>17.</strong> For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.</p>
<p id='19_49:018'><strong>18.</strong> For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed —and though you get praise when you do well for yourself—</p>
<p id='19_49:019'><strong>19.</strong> his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light.</p>
<p id='19_49:020'><strong>20.</strong> Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_50'>Chapter 50</h2>
<p id='19_50:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.</p>
<p id='19_50:002'><strong>2.</strong> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.</p>
<p id='19_50:003'><strong>3.</strong> Our God comes; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest.</p>
<p id='19_50:004'><strong>4.</strong> He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people:</p>
<p id='19_50:005'><strong>5.</strong> Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!</p>
<p id='19_50:006'><strong>6.</strong> The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge! Selah</p>
<p id='19_50:007'><strong>7.</strong> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.</p>
<p id='19_50:008'><strong>8.</strong> Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me.</p>
<p id='19_50:009'><strong>9.</strong> I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds.</p>
<p id='19_50:010'><strong>10.</strong> For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.</p>
<p id='19_50:011'><strong>11.</strong> I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine.</p>
<p id='19_50:012'><strong>12.</strong> If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine.</p>
<p id='19_50:013'><strong>13.</strong> Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?</p>
<p id='19_50:014'><strong>14.</strong> Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High,</p>
<p id='19_50:015'><strong>15.</strong> and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.</p>
<p id='19_50:016'><strong>16.</strong> But to the wicked God says: What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips?</p>
<p id='19_50:017'><strong>17.</strong> For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.</p>
<p id='19_50:018'><strong>18.</strong> If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers.</p>
<p id='19_50:019'><strong>19.</strong> You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.</p>
<p id='19_50:020'><strong>20.</strong> You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.</p>
<p id='19_50:021'><strong>21.</strong> These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you.</p>
<p id='19_50:022'><strong>22.</strong> Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver!</p>
<p id='19_50:023'><strong>23.</strong> The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!</p>
<h2 id='chapter_51'>Chapter 51</h2>
<p id='19_51:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.</p>
<p id='19_51:002'><strong>2.</strong> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!</p>
<p id='19_51:003'><strong>3.</strong> For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.</p>
<p id='19_51:004'><strong>4.</strong> Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.</p>
<p id='19_51:005'><strong>5.</strong> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
<p id='19_51:006'><strong>6.</strong> Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.</p>
<p id='19_51:007'><strong>7.</strong> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
<p id='19_51:008'><strong>8.</strong> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.</p>
<p id='19_51:009'><strong>9.</strong> Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>
<p id='19_51:010'><strong>10.</strong> Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
<p id='19_51:011'><strong>11.</strong> Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.</p>
<p id='19_51:012'><strong>12.</strong> Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.</p>
<p id='19_51:013'><strong>13.</strong> Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.</p>
<p id='19_51:014'><strong>14.</strong> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.</p>
<p id='19_51:015'><strong>15.</strong> O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.</p>
<p id='19_51:016'><strong>16.</strong> For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.</p>
<p id='19_51:017'><strong>17.</strong> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</p>
<p id='19_51:018'><strong>18.</strong> Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem;</p>
<p id='19_51:019'><strong>19.</strong> then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_52'>Chapter 52</h2>
<p id='19_52:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster. A Maskil of David, when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, David has come to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day.</p>
<p id='19_52:002'><strong>2.</strong> Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.</p>
<p id='19_52:003'><strong>3.</strong> You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah</p>
<p id='19_52:004'><strong>4.</strong> You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.</p>
<p id='19_52:005'><strong>5.</strong> But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah</p>
<p id='19_52:006'><strong>6.</strong> The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,</p>
<p id='19_52:007'><strong>7.</strong> See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!</p>
<p id='19_52:008'><strong>8.</strong> But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.</p>
<p id='19_52:009'><strong>9.</strong> I will thank you forever, because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_53'>Chapter 53</h2>
<p id='19_53:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: according to Mahalath. A Maskil of David. The fool says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good.</p>
<p id='19_53:002'><strong>2.</strong> God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.</p>
<p id='19_53:003'><strong>3.</strong> They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.</p>
<p id='19_53:004'><strong>4.</strong> Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?</p>
<p id='19_53:005'><strong>5.</strong> There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them.</p>
<p id='19_53:006'><strong>6.</strong> Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_54'>Chapter 54</h2>
<p id='19_54:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, Is not David hiding among us? O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might.</p>
<p id='19_54:002'><strong>2.</strong> O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p id='19_54:003'><strong>3.</strong> For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah</p>
<p id='19_54:004'><strong>4.</strong> Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.</p>
<p id='19_54:005'><strong>5.</strong> He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them.</p>
<p id='19_54:006'><strong>6.</strong> With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good.</p>
<p id='19_54:007'><strong>7.</strong> For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_55'>Chapter 55</h2>
<p id='19_55:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!</p>
<p id='19_55:002'><strong>2.</strong> Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan,</p>
<p id='19_55:003'><strong>3.</strong> because of the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me, and in anger they bear a grudge against me.</p>
<p id='19_55:004'><strong>4.</strong> My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me.</p>
<p id='19_55:005'><strong>5.</strong> Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.</p>
<p id='19_55:006'><strong>6.</strong> And I say, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;</p>
<p id='19_55:007'><strong>7.</strong> yes, I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah</p>
<p id='19_55:008'><strong>8.</strong> I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest.</p>
<p id='19_55:009'><strong>9.</strong> Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city.</p>
<p id='19_55:010'><strong>10.</strong> Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it;</p>
<p id='19_55:011'><strong>11.</strong> ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace.</p>
<p id='19_55:012'><strong>12.</strong> For it is not an enemy who taunts me— then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me— then I could hide from him.</p>
<p id='19_55:013'><strong>13.</strong> But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend.</p>
<p id='19_55:014'><strong>14.</strong> We used to take sweet counsel together; within God’s house we walked in the throng.</p>
<p id='19_55:015'><strong>15.</strong> Let death steal over them; let them go down to Sheol alive; for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart.</p>
<p id='19_55:016'><strong>16.</strong> But I call to God, and the Lord will save me.</p>
<p id='19_55:017'><strong>17.</strong> Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he hears my voice.</p>
<p id='19_55:018'><strong>18.</strong> He redeems my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.</p>
<p id='19_55:019'><strong>19.</strong> God will give ear and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old, Selah because they do not change and do not fear God.</p>
<p id='19_55:020'><strong>20.</strong> My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant.</p>
<p id='19_55:021'><strong>21.</strong> His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.</p>
<p id='19_55:022'><strong>22.</strong> Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.</p>
<p id='19_55:023'><strong>23.</strong> But you, O God, will cast them down into the pit of destruction; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_56'>Chapter 56</h2>
<p id='19_56:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths. A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me;</p>
<p id='19_56:002'><strong>2.</strong> my enemies trample on me all day long, for many attack me proudly.</p>
<p id='19_56:003'><strong>3.</strong> When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.</p>

<p id='19_56:005'><strong>5.</strong> All day long they injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.</p>
<p id='19_56:006'><strong>6.</strong> They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life.</p>
<p id='19_56:007'><strong>7.</strong> For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples, O God!</p>
<p id='19_56:008'><strong>8.</strong> You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book?</p>
<p id='19_56:009'><strong>9.</strong> Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.</p>
<p id='19_56:010'><strong>10.</strong> In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise,</p>
<p id='19_56:011'><strong>11.</strong> in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?</p>
<p id='19_56:012'><strong>12.</strong> I must perform my vows to you, O God; I will render thank offerings to you.</p>
<p id='19_56:013'><strong>13.</strong> For you have delivered my soul from death, yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_57'>Chapter 57</h2>
<p id='19_57:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.</p>
<p id='19_57:002'><strong>2.</strong> I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me.</p>
<p id='19_57:003'><strong>3.</strong> He will send from heaven and save me; he will put to shame him who tramples on me. Selah God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness!</p>
<p id='19_57:004'><strong>4.</strong> My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts — the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.</p>
<p id='19_57:005'><strong>5.</strong> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!</p>
<p id='19_57:006'><strong>6.</strong> They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah</p>
<p id='19_57:007'><strong>7.</strong> My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody!</p>

<h2 id='chapter_58'>Chapter 58</h2>
<p id='19_58:001'><strong>1.</strong> To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David. Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly?</p>
<p id='19_58:002'><strong>2.</strong> No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.</p>
<p id='19_58:003'><strong>3.</strong> The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.</p>
<p id='19_58:004'><strong>4.</strong> They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,</p>
<p id='19_58:005'><strong>5.</strong> so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.</p>
<p id='19_58:006'><strong>6.</strong> O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord!</p>
<p id='19_58:007'><strong>7.</strong> Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted.</p>

<p id='19_58:009'><strong>9.</strong> Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!</p>
<p id='19_58:010'><strong>10.</strong> The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>

<p id='19_78:010'><strong>10.</strong> They did not keep God’s covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.</p>
<p id='19_78:011'><strong>11.</strong> They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.</p>
<p id='19_78:012'><strong>12.</strong> In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.</p>
<p id='19_78:013'><strong>13.</strong> He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.</p>
<p id='19_78:014'><strong>14.</strong> In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light.</p>
<p id='19_78:015'><strong>15.</strong> He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.</p>
<p id='19_78:016'><strong>16.</strong> He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.</p>
<p id='19_78:017'><strong>17.</strong> Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.</p>
<p id='19_78:018'><strong>18.</strong> They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.</p>
<p id='19_78:019'><strong>19.</strong> They spoke against God, saying, Can God spread a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p id='19_78:020'><strong>20.</strong> He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?</p>
<p id='19_78:021'><strong>21.</strong> Therefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel,</p>
<p id='19_78:022'><strong>22.</strong> because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.</p>
<p id='19_78:023'><strong>23.</strong> Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p id='19_78:024'><strong>24.</strong> and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven.</p>
<p id='19_78:025'><strong>25.</strong> Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.</p>
<p id='19_78:026'><strong>26.</strong> He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;</p>
<p id='19_78:027'><strong>27.</strong> he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;</p>
<p id='19_78:028'><strong>28.</strong> he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.</p>
<p id='19_78:029'><strong>29.</strong> And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.</p>
<p id='19_78:030'><strong>30.</strong> But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,</p>
<p id='19_78:031'><strong>31.</strong> the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.</p>
<p id='19_78:032'><strong>32.</strong> In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe.</p>
<p id='19_78:033'><strong>33.</strong> So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.</p>
<p id='19_78:034'><strong>34.</strong> When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly.</p>
<p id='19_78:035'><strong>35.</strong> They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.</p>
<p id='19_78:036'><strong>36.</strong> But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.</p>
<p id='19_78:037'><strong>37.</strong> Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant.</p>
<p id='19_78:038'><strong>38.</strong> Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p id='19_78:039'><strong>39.</strong> He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.</p>
<p id='19_78:040'><strong>40.</strong> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!</p>
<p id='19_78:041'><strong>41.</strong> They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p id='19_78:042'><strong>42.</strong> They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,</p>
<p id='19_78:043'><strong>43.</strong> when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan.</p>
<p id='19_78:044'><strong>44.</strong> He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.</p>
<p id='19_78:045'><strong>45.</strong> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p id='19_78:046'><strong>46.</strong> He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust.</p>
<p id='19_78:047'><strong>47.</strong> He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.</p>
<p id='19_78:048'><strong>48.</strong> He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts.</p>
<p id='19_78:049'><strong>49.</strong> He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.</p>
<p id='19_78:050'><strong>50.</strong> He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.</p>
<p id='19_78:051'><strong>51.</strong> He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p>
<p id='19_78:052'><strong>52.</strong> Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>

<p id='19_78:054'><strong>54.</strong> And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.</p>
<p id='19_78:055'><strong>55.</strong> He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.</p>
<p id='19_78:056'><strong>56.</strong> Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies,</p>
<p id='19_78:057'><strong>57.</strong> but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p id='19_78:058'><strong>58.</strong> For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.</p>
<p id='19_78:059'><strong>59.</strong> When God heard, he was wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.</p>
<p id='19_78:060'><strong>60.</strong> He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind,</p>
<p id='19_78:061'><strong>61.</strong> and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.</p>
<p id='19_78:062'><strong>62.</strong> He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage.</p>
<p id='19_78:063'><strong>63.</strong> Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song.</p>
<p id='19_78:064'><strong>64.</strong> Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p id='19_78:065'><strong>65.</strong> Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.</p>
<p id='19_78:066'><strong>66.</strong> And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.</p>
<p id='19_78:067'><strong>67.</strong> He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p>
<p id='19_78:068'><strong>68.</strong> but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.</p>
<p id='19_78:069'><strong>69.</strong> He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever.</p>
<p id='19_78:070'><strong>70.</strong> He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds;</p>
<p id='19_78:071'><strong>71.</strong> from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p id='19_78:072'><strong>72.</strong> With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand.</p>

<p id='19_101:002'><strong>2.</strong> I will ponder the way that is blameless. Oh when will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house;</p>
<p id='19_101:003'><strong>3.</strong> I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.</p>
<p id='19_101:004'><strong>4.</strong> A perverse heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil.</p>
<p id='19_101:005'><strong>5.</strong> Whoever slanders his neighbor secretly I will destroy. Whoever has a haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not endure.</p>
<p id='19_101:006'><strong>6.</strong> I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me.</p>
<p id='19_101:007'><strong>7.</strong> No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.</p>
<p id='19_101:008'><strong>8.</strong> Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land, cutting off all the evildoers from the city of the Lord.</p>
<h2 id='chapter_102'>Chapter 102</h2>
<p id='19_102:001'><strong>1.</strong> A Prayer of one afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the Lord. Hear my prayer, O Lord; let my cry come to you!</p>
<p id='19_102:002'><strong>2.</strong> Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call!</p>
<p id='19_102:003'><strong>3.</strong> For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.</p>
<p id='19_102:004'><strong>4.</strong> My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread.</p>
<p id='19_102:005'><strong>5.</strong> Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh.</p>
<p id='19_102:006'><strong>6.</strong> I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places;</p>
<p id='19_102:007'><strong>7.</strong> I lie awake; I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop.</p>
<p id='19_102:008'><strong>8.</strong> All the day my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse.</p>
<p id='19_102:009'><strong>9.</strong> For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink,</p>
<p id='19_102:010'><strong>10.</strong> because of your indignation and anger; for you have taken me up and thrown me down.</p>
<p id='19_102:011'><strong>11.</strong> My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass.</p>
<p id='19_102:012'><strong>12.</strong> But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations.</p>
<p id='19_102:013'><strong>13.</strong> You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come.</p>
<p id='19_102:014'><strong>14.</strong> For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust.</p>
<p id='19_102:015'><strong>15.</strong> Nations will fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory.</p>
<p id='19_102:016'><strong>16.</strong> For the Lord builds up Zion; he appears in his glory;</p>
<p id='19_102:017'><strong>17.</strong> he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer.</p>
<p id='19_102:018'><strong>18.</strong> Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord:</p>
<p id='19_102:019'><strong>19.</strong> that he looked down from his holy height; from heaven the Lord looked at the earth,</p>
<p id='19_102:020'><strong>20.</strong> to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die,</p>
<p id='19_102:021'><strong>21.</strong> that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord, and in Jerusalem his praise,</p>
<p id='19_102:022'><strong>22.</strong> when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_102:023'><strong>23.</strong> He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days.</p>
<p id='19_102:024'><strong>24.</strong> O my God, I say, take me not away in the midst of my days — you whose years endure throughout all generations!</p>
<p id='19_102:025'><strong>25.</strong> Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>
<p id='19_102:026'><strong>26.</strong> They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away,</p>
<p id='19_102:027'><strong>27.</strong> but you are the same, and your years have no end.</p>
<p id='19_102:028'><strong>28.</strong> The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you.</p>

<p id='19_103:009'><strong>9.</strong> He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever.</p>
<p id='19_103:010'><strong>10.</strong> He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.</p>

<p id='19_103:013'><strong>13.</strong> As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.</p>
<p id='19_103:014'><strong>14.</strong> For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.</p>
<p id='19_103:015'><strong>15.</strong> As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field;</p>
<p id='19_103:016'><strong>16.</strong> for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.</p>
<p id='19_103:017'><strong>17.</strong> But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children,</p>

<p id='19_103:019'><strong>19.</strong> The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.</p>

<p id='19_104:004'><strong>4.</strong> he makes his messengers winds, his ministers a flaming fire.</p>
<p id='19_104:005'><strong>5.</strong> He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved.</p>
<p id='19_104:006'><strong>6.</strong> You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p id='19_104:007'><strong>7.</strong> At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they took to flight.</p>
<p id='19_104:008'><strong>8.</strong> The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place that you appointed for them.</p>
<p id='19_104:009'><strong>9.</strong> You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth.</p>
<p id='19_104:010'><strong>10.</strong> You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills;</p>
<p id='19_104:011'><strong>11.</strong> they give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</p>
<p id='19_104:012'><strong>12.</strong> Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches.</p>
<p id='19_104:013'><strong>13.</strong> From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.</p>
<p id='19_104:014'><strong>14.</strong> You cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth</p>
<p id='19_104:015'><strong>15.</strong> and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man’s heart.</p>
<p id='19_104:016'><strong>16.</strong> The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</p>
<p id='19_104:017'><strong>17.</strong> In them the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees.</p>
<p id='19_104:018'><strong>18.</strong> The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.</p>
<p id='19_104:019'><strong>19.</strong> He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.</p>
<p id='19_104:020'><strong>20.</strong> You make darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep about.</p>
<p id='19_104:021'><strong>21.</strong> The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.</p>
<p id='19_104:022'><strong>22.</strong> When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down in their dens.</p>
<p id='19_104:023'><strong>23.</strong> Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening.</p>
<p id='19_104:024'><strong>24.</strong> O Lord, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</p>

<p id='19_104:026'><strong>26.</strong> There go the ships, and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.</p>
<p id='19_104:027'><strong>27.</strong> These all look to you, to give them their food in due season.</p>
<p id='19_104:028'><strong>28.</strong> When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.</p>

<p id='19_105:009'><strong>9.</strong> the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,</p>
<p id='19_105:010'><strong>10.</strong> which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,</p>

<p id='19_105:012'><strong>12.</strong> When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,</p>
<p id='19_105:013'><strong>13.</strong> wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,</p>
<p id='19_105:014'><strong>14.</strong> he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,</p>
<p id='19_105:015'><strong>15.</strong> saying, Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!</p>
<p id='19_105:016'><strong>16.</strong> When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread,</p>
<p id='19_105:017'><strong>17.</strong> he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.</p>
<p id='19_105:018'><strong>18.</strong> His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron;</p>
<p id='19_105:019'><strong>19.</strong> until what he had said came to pass, the word of the Lord tested him.</p>
<p id='19_105:020'><strong>20.</strong> The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free;</p>
<p id='19_105:021'><strong>21.</strong> he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions,</p>
<p id='19_105:022'><strong>22.</strong> to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom.</p>
<p id='19_105:023'><strong>23.</strong> Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
<p id='19_105:024'><strong>24.</strong> And the Lord made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes.</p>
<p id='19_105:025'><strong>25.</strong> He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.</p>
<p id='19_105:026'><strong>26.</strong> He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</p>
<p id='19_105:027'><strong>27.</strong> They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham.</p>
<p id='19_105:028'><strong>28.</strong> He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words.</p>
<p id='19_105:029'><strong>29.</strong> He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.</p>
<p id='19_105:030'><strong>30.</strong> Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p id='19_105:031'><strong>31.</strong> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</p>
<p id='19_105:032'><strong>32.</strong> He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land.</p>
<p id='19_105:033'><strong>33.</strong> He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.</p>
<p id='19_105:034'><strong>34.</strong> He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number,</p>
<p id='19_105:035'><strong>35.</strong> which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p id='19_105:036'><strong>36.</strong> He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.</p>
<p id='19_105:037'><strong>37.</strong> Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.</p>
<p id='19_105:038'><strong>38.</strong> Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.</p>
<p id='19_105:039'><strong>39.</strong> He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.</p>
<p id='19_105:040'><strong>40.</strong> They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.</p>
<p id='19_105:041'><strong>41.</strong> He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.</p>
<p id='19_105:042'><strong>42.</strong> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant.</p>
<p id='19_105:043'><strong>43.</strong> So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.</p>
<p id='19_105:044'><strong>44.</strong> And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples ’ toil,</p>

<p id='19_106:006'><strong>6.</strong> Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.</p>
<p id='19_106:007'><strong>7.</strong> Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.</p>
<p id='19_106:008'><strong>8.</strong> Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make known his mighty power.</p>
<p id='19_106:009'><strong>9.</strong> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.</p>
<p id='19_106:010'><strong>10.</strong> So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.</p>
<p id='19_106:011'><strong>11.</strong> And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.</p>
<p id='19_106:012'><strong>12.</strong> Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p id='19_106:013'><strong>13.</strong> But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.</p>
<p id='19_106:014'><strong>14.</strong> But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;</p>
<p id='19_106:015'><strong>15.</strong> he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.</p>
<p id='19_106:016'><strong>16.</strong> When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord,</p>
<p id='19_106:017'><strong>17.</strong> the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p id='19_106:018'><strong>18.</strong> Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p id='19_106:019'><strong>19.</strong> They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image.</p>
<p id='19_106:020'><strong>20.</strong> They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.</p>
<p id='19_106:021'><strong>21.</strong> They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,</p>
<p id='19_106:022'><strong>22.</strong> wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</p>
<p id='19_106:023'><strong>23.</strong> Therefore he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.</p>
<p id='19_106:024'><strong>24.</strong> Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.</p>
<p id='19_106:025'><strong>25.</strong> They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the Lord.</p>
<p id='19_106:026'><strong>26.</strong> Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,</p>
<p id='19_106:027'><strong>27.</strong> and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands.</p>
<p id='19_106:028'><strong>28.</strong> Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;</p>
<p id='19_106:029'><strong>29.</strong> they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</p>
<p id='19_106:030'><strong>30.</strong> Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed.</p>
<p id='19_106:031'><strong>31.</strong> And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.</p>
<p id='19_106:032'><strong>32.</strong> They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account,</p>
<p id='19_106:033'><strong>33.</strong> for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips.</p>
<p id='19_106:034'><strong>34.</strong> They did not destroy the peoples, as the Lord commanded them,</p>
<p id='19_106:035'><strong>35.</strong> but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did.</p>
<p id='19_106:036'><strong>36.</strong> They served their idols, which became a snare to them.</p>
<p id='19_106:037'><strong>37.</strong> They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;</p>
<p id='19_106:038'><strong>38.</strong> they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p id='19_106:039'><strong>39.</strong> Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds.</p>
<p id='19_106:040'><strong>40.</strong> Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;</p>
<p id='19_106:041'><strong>41.</strong> he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p id='19_106:042'><strong>42.</strong> Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.</p>
<p id='19_106:043'><strong>43.</strong> Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity.</p>
<p id='19_106:044'><strong>44.</strong> Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.</p>
<p id='19_106:045'><strong>45.</strong> For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.</p>
<p id='19_106:046'><strong>46.</strong> He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.</p>
<p id='19_106:047'><strong>47.</strong> Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</p>
