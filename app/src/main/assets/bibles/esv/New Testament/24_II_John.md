# II John <!-- Start Verse Index: 30646 -->

## Chapter 1

**1.** The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth, <!-- Index: 30646 -->

**2.** because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: <!-- Index: 30647 -->

**3.** Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father’s Son, in truth and love. <!-- Index: 30648 -->

**4.** I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. <!-- Index: 30649 -->

**5.** And now I ask you, dear lady — not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning — that we love one another. <!-- Index: 30650 -->

**6.** And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. <!-- Index: 30651 -->

**7.** For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. <!-- Index: 30652 -->

**8.** Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. <!-- Index: 30653 -->

**9.** Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. <!-- Index: 30654 -->

**10.** If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, <!-- Index: 30655 -->

**11.** for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works. <!-- Index: 30656 -->

**12.** Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete. <!-- Index: 30657 -->

**13.** The children of your elect sister greet you. <!-- Index: 30658 -->
