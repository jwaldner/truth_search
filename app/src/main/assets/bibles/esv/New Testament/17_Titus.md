**2.** in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began <!-- Index: 29894 -->

**5.** This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you — <!-- Index: 29897 -->

**2.** Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. <!-- Index: 29910 -->

**3.** Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good, <!-- Index: 29911 -->

**11.** For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, <!-- Index: 29919 -->

**12.** training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, <!-- Index: 29920 -->

**13.** waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, <!-- Index: 29921 -->

**14.** who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. <!-- Index: 29922 -->

**15.** Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you. <!-- Index: 29923 -->

## Chapter 3

**1.** Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, <!-- Index: 29924 -->

**2.** to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people. <!-- Index: 29925 -->

**4.** But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, <!-- Index: 29927 -->

**5.** he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, <!-- Index: 29928 -->

**6.** whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, <!-- Index: 29929 -->

**7.** so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. <!-- Index: 29930 -->

**8.** The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people. <!-- Index: 29931 -->

**9.** But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. <!-- Index: 29932 -->

**10.** As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, <!-- Index: 29933 -->

**11.** knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned. <!-- Index: 29934 -->

**12.** When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. <!-- Index: 29935 -->

**13.** Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing. <!-- Index: 29936 -->
