<h1>II John</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='63_01:001'><strong>1.</strong> The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth,</p>
<p id='63_01:002'><strong>2.</strong> because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</p>
<p id='63_01:003'><strong>3.</strong> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father’s Son, in truth and love.</p>
<p id='63_01:004'><strong>4.</strong> I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.</p>
<p id='63_01:005'><strong>5.</strong> And now I ask you, dear lady — not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning — that we love one another.</p>
<p id='63_01:006'><strong>6.</strong> And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.</p>
<p id='63_01:007'><strong>7.</strong> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p>
<p id='63_01:008'><strong>8.</strong> Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward.</p>
<p id='63_01:009'><strong>9.</strong> Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p id='63_01:010'><strong>10.</strong> If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,</p>
<p id='63_01:011'><strong>11.</strong> for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.</p>
<p id='63_01:012'><strong>12.</strong> Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</p>
<p id='63_01:013'><strong>13.</strong> The children of your elect sister greet you.</p>
