<h1>Philemon</h1>
<h2 id='chapter_1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<p id='57_01:001'><strong>1.</strong> Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker</p>
<p id='57_01:002'><strong>2.</strong> and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:</p>
<p id='57_01:003'><strong>3.</strong> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id='57_01:004'><strong>4.</strong> I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,</p>
<p id='57_01:005'><strong>5.</strong> because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,</p>
<p id='57_01:006'><strong>6.</strong> and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.</p>
<p id='57_01:007'><strong>7.</strong> For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</p>
<p id='57_01:008'><strong>8.</strong> Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,</p>
<p id='57_01:009'><strong>9.</strong> yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you — I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus —</p>
<p id='57_01:010'><strong>10.</strong> I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.</p>
<p id='57_01:011'><strong>11.</strong> ( Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)</p>
<p id='57_01:012'><strong>12.</strong> I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.</p>
<p id='57_01:013'><strong>13.</strong> I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,</p>
<p id='57_01:014'><strong>14.</strong> but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord.</p>
<p id='57_01:015'><strong>15.</strong> For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,</p>
<p id='57_01:016'><strong>16.</strong> no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother — especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p id='57_01:017'><strong>17.</strong> So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.</p>
<p id='57_01:018'><strong>18.</strong> If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</p>
<p id='57_01:019'><strong>19.</strong> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.</p>
<p id='57_01:020'><strong>20.</strong> Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p id='57_01:021'><strong>21.</strong> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</p>
<p id='57_01:022'><strong>22.</strong> At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</p>
<p id='57_01:023'><strong>23.</strong> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,</p>
<p id='57_01:024'><strong>24.</strong> and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
<p id='57_01:025'><strong>25.</strong> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
