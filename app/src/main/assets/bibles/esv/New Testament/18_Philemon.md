# Philemon <!-- Start Verse Index: 29939 -->

## Chapter 1

**1.** Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker <!-- Index: 29939 -->

**2.** and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house: <!-- Index: 29940 -->

**3.** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <!-- Index: 29941 -->

**4.** I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, <!-- Index: 29942 -->

**5.** because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, <!-- Index: 29943 -->

**6.** and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. <!-- Index: 29944 -->

**7.** For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. <!-- Index: 29945 -->

**8.** Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, <!-- Index: 29946 -->

**9.** yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you — I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus — <!-- Index: 29947 -->

**10.** I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. <!-- Index: 29948 -->

**11.** ( Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) <!-- Index: 29949 -->

**12.** I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. <!-- Index: 29950 -->

**13.** I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, <!-- Index: 29951 -->

**14.** but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. <!-- Index: 29952 -->

**15.** For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, <!-- Index: 29953 -->

**16.** no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother — especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. <!-- Index: 29954 -->

**17.** So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. <!-- Index: 29955 -->

**18.** If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. <!-- Index: 29956 -->

**19.** I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. <!-- Index: 29957 -->

**20.** Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. <!-- Index: 29958 -->

**21.** Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. <!-- Index: 29959 -->

**22.** At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you. <!-- Index: 29960 -->

**23.** Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, <!-- Index: 29961 -->

**24.** and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. <!-- Index: 29962 -->

**25.** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. <!-- Index: 29963 -->
